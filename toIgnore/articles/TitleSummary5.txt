	Dynamic responses of primary human bronchial epithelial cells to influenza virus, viral RNA and interferon-beta 	We defined the major transcriptional responses in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) after either infection with influenza or treatment with relevant ligands. We used four different strategies, each highlighting distinct aspects of the response. (1) cells were infected with the wild-type PR8 influenza virus that can mount a complete replicative cycle. (2) cells were transfected with viral RNA (‘vRNA’) isolated from influenza particles. This does not result in the production of viral proteins or particles and identifies the effect of RNA-sensing pathways (e.g., RIG-I.). (3) Cells were treated with interferon beta (IFNb), to distinguish the portion of the response which is mediated through Type I IFNs. (4) Cells were infected with a PR8 virus lacking the NS1 gene (‘DNS1’). The NS1 protein normally inhibits vRNA- or IFNb-induced pathways, and its deletion can reveal an expanded response to infection.
