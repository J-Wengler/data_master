abstract\ approimately 5%\'9610% of breast cancers are due to genetic predisposition caused by germline mutations; the most commonly tested genes are brca1 and brca2 mutations.some mutations are unique to one family and others are recurrent; the spectrum of brca1/brca2 mutations varies depending on the geographical origins, populations or ethnic groups.in this review, we compiled data from 11 participating asian countries (bangladesh, mainland china, hong kong sar, indonesia, japan, korea, malaysia, philippines, singapore, thailand and vietnam), and from ethnic asians residing in canada and the usa.we have additionally conducted a literature review to include other asian countries mainly in central and western asia.we present the current pathogenic mutation spectrum of brca1/brca2 genes in patients with breast cancer in various asian populations.understanding brca1/brca2 mutations in asians will help provide better risk assessment and clinical management of breast cancer.\ \ go to:\ introduction\ breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy and the most leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide.in 2012, there were estimated to be 522 000 breast cancer deaths, which accounted for 14.7% of all cancer deaths among women (globocan 2012, <url> according to the american cancer society, the 5-year survival rate for patients with breast cancer ranged from 22% to 100% according to the cancer stages, but this varies for different geographical origins.1 familial breast cancer accounts for 5%\'9610% of all breast cancers and is known to be caused by germline mutations in certain genes.2 deleterious mutations in breast cancer-associated genes (brca1 and brca2) account for 20%\'9640% of the familial breast cancer.3,4 women with brca1/brca2 mutations have very high lifetime risks of developing breast and ovarian cancer.5 meta-analyses indicated that brca1 mutation carriers have a 57%\'9665% lifetime probability of developing breast cancer while brca2 carriers have a 45%\'9649% lifetime probability.6,7 although there are increasing reports from asia, the majority of studies to date have focused on the prevalence and spectrum of brca1 and brca2 mutations in white populations from europe and north america, african and african\'96american populations.asians comprise 60% of the 7 billion people in the world and this population is rapidly increasing.the two most populated countries alone, china and india, constitute 37% of the world population.according to the us census bureau, 4.8% of the american populations are asians.hence, there is a need for better understanding of the mutation spectrum of these high-penetrance genes and cancer risk prediction in asians, so that appropriate genetic testing and management/surveillance programmes can be implemented.globally, there are important differences in age-specific incidence rates of breast cancer between countries and between ethnic groups.8 in this review, we summarise the current spectrum of deleterious brca1 and brca2 mutations including novel, previously unpublished mutations among asian countries, and where available, those asians residing in western countries.\ \ go to:\ study population\ our cohort represents a study population from 47 asian countries under the geographical definition from globocan, together with regions including hong kong and taiwan, and the asian populations residing in north america.mutational information of brca1 and brca2 genes (genbank accession number: u14680.1 and u43746.1 respectively) were collected from the hong kong hereditary breast cancer family registry (<url> korean hereditary breast cancer study, study groups of the asian hereditary breast cancer consortium (abrca) and collaborating centres in north america (canada and usa).we also consolidated data from the breast cancer information core (bic), human genome variation society, unpublished data and published literatures of brca1/brca2 mutations in asia (including india, pakistan, turkey, iran, iraq, syria, yemen and other asian countries).only pathogenic mutations in brca1/brca2 genes, which cause deleterious effects to the protein functions, were included in this report.other genetic variants of uncertain clinical significance (namely vus) are out of the scope of this study and will be published as a separate study by the abrca consortium group.\ \ this study was approved by the institutional review board (irb) of the university of hong kong and irbs of the collaborating centres.mutational information of brca1 and brca2 were generated, specifically (1) mutation type; (2) date/year of test result; (3) patient ethnicity; (4) country where the mutation was identified; (5) frequency of entries in bic; and (6) whether the mutation has been reported to be recurrent or founder mutation.literature search also included mutation frequencies in specific groups including patients with breast cancer at young age, triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc) and bilateral breast cancer.the distribution of brca1 and brca2 mutations in each country was also recorded.\ \ selection criteria\ the inclusion criteria for brca1/brca2 genetic testing varied among research groups in our study and in the published literatures, and are summarised in table 1. in general, the study samples consisted of high-risk individuals of familial breast and/or ovarian cancer who satisfied any one of the following criteria:\ \ having a strong family history of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer;\ \ having early-onset breast cancer, diagnosed at age less than 50 years;\ \ having bilateral breast cancer;\ \ having tnbc;\ \ having male breast cancer;\ \ having medullary type pathology;\ \ having a family history of cancer, other than breast or ovary, which are known to be related to brca1/brca2 mutations, such as stomach and prostate;\ \ having ovarian cancer and a family history of breast cancer.\ \ brca1/brca2 pathogenic mutations in asians\ in this review, all the novel or unpublished brca1/brca2 mutation information were collected through the abrca including research groups from bangladesh, mainland china, hong kong, indonesia, japan, korea, malaysia, philippines, singapore, thailand and vietnam, together with the collaborating centres in north america.published mutation data were obtained through literature search.to the best of our knowledge, this is the most up-to-date overview of the brca1/brca2 pathogenic mutation spectrum in asian population available.table 2 illustrates the total numbers of brca1/brca2 distinct mutations and mutation-positive cases, and a selection of the most frequent mutations identified in each asian country and in north america.the full spectra of germline brca1/brca2 deleterious mutations are listed in the online supplementary tables s1 and s2.to date, 510 distinct types of deleterious brca1/brca2 mutations (268 brca1 and 242 brca2) have been identified in asian patients with breast cancer, most of which are frameshift or nonsense mutations.\ the most common brca1 mutation reported in our data set was 185delag (c.68_69delag; number of cases: 29), which is a well-known ashkenazi jewish mutation, and this mutation was detected in the indian and arabic populations, but not in eastern asia.the second most reported brca1 mutation was c.390c>a (number of cases: 28), which was solely found in the japanese and korean patients.other common brca1 mutations include c.470_471delct (number of cases: 16; bic entries: 10) and c.981_982delat (number of cases: 9; bic entries: 9).brca1 c.470_471delct mutation was identified in chinese patients that were populated in hong kong, malaysia and the usa, and was also identified in japanese and pakistani patients.brca1 c.981_982delat was seen in chinese and korean patients in hong kong, korea, malaysia and shanghai.both of these mutations were identified as recurrent mutation in chinese population, which contributed to 20.6% of all brca1 mutations in the chinese cohort in hong kong, southern china.14\ \ the most common brca2 mutations were brca2 c.7480c>t (number of cases: 53; bic entries: 11), c.1399a>t (number of cases: 29; bic entries: 2) and c.3744_3747deltgag (number of cases: 26; bic entries: 8).they were frequently observed in korean and chinese patients.\ \ to date, there are 28 distinct mutations in brca1 gene and 41 mutations in brca2 gene that have neither been previously reported nor been listed in the bic database (see online supplementary tables s1 and s2); thus they are considered to be novel mutations identified in asian populations.among these novel mutations, four brca1 and eight brca2 distinct mutations had been identified in more than one individual.in this study, 40 brca1 and 25 brca2 mutations, comprising 12.7% (65 of 510) of all distinct mutations, were listed in the bic database with records of asian ethnicities only, suggesting that these could be the asian-specific pathogenic mutations.\ \ there were 41 distinct brca1 mutations and 35 brca2 mutations reported in multiple locations across asia, and some were also found in the asian populations of north america (see online supplementary tables s1 and s2).these recurrent mutations accounted for 37.5% (233 of 622) of all brca1 mutation-positive cases and 36.9% (215 of 583) of all brca2 mutation-positive cases in this report (table 2).in total, the frequency of brca1 mutations outnumber that of brca2 mutations (622 vs 583).however, this was not the case in all asian countries; in china, hong kong, korea and philippines, brca2 mutations outnumber that of brca1 mutations (table 2).in most non-asian countries the total frequency of brca2 mutations observed in asian populations is more than that for brca1 mutations.however, the reverse situation was usually observed in caucasian or other non-asian populations.61\'9663 a number of common mutations specific to non-european populations have been reported in hispanic, african\'96american, middle eastern and asian populations.64,65\ \ in asia, the prevalence of brca1/brca2 mutations from unselected patients with breast cancer had been reported to range from 0.8% to 4.4% (all age groups).34,66,67 this is comparable to data from western countries (1.8% to 3.6%).68 nonetheless, the reported prevalence varies from country to country; a recent report indicated that the prevalence of brca1/brca2 mutations in korea from patients with non-familial high-risk breast cancer was 9.8%.69\ \ there are mutations which have been recurrently seen across different countries.to the best of our knowledge, there is no report showing that families sharing the same mutation among the countries were related.all the haplotyping was done in their own countries as it is rather difficult to obtain the samples for analysis.this would be an important piece of missing information that needs to be answered; therefore a consortium has been established to clarify this issue.\ \ brca1/brca2 mutations, in particular, brca1 mutations are associated with young age of onset of cancer and with tnbc.table 3 summarises the relationship of brca1/brca2 mutations and these phenotypic characteristics which have been reported in asia.the definition of young age for the purposes of testing varied between studies, and cut-offs ranged from 30 to 45 years.in singapore, young age was defined as <30 years, whereas in hong kong young age was defined as <45 years, the suggested age of testing criteria under the national comprehensive cancer network clinical practice guidelines in oncology (nccn guidelines) for \'91genetic/familial high-risk assessment: breast and ovarian\'92.based on positive family history, studies from korea, hong kong and malaysia contained probands with the highest proportions of patients (ranged from 50% to 61%) who had family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer.however, this proportion varied greatly among different asian countries, due to their relatively small study cohort sizes, and further study is needed in order to provide more accurate estimation in different countries.tnbc is featured by the absence or lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 phenotype, and it accounts for 10%\'9620% of all breast cancers.tnbc has been reported to be associated with brca1/brca2 mutation, where 50% of high-risk patients with tnbc and a positive family history were tested positive for brca1/brca2 mutation.80 brca1/brca2 mutation was detected in approimately 40% of unselected ashkenazi jewish women with tnbc, and the majority of these were brca1 mutation.81 in the usa, there was a higher proportion of brca1 mutation (20%) than brca2 mutation (4%) in patients with tnbc.82 likewise, in the asian populations, more tnbc cases were found to be associated with brca1 mutation than brca2 mutations.several chinese cohort studies showed that the prevalence of brca1 mutations among selected patients with tnbc ranged from 18.6% to 36.8%, while brca2 mutation only ranged from 7.3% to 10.5%.13,75,76 a similar discrepancy in brca1/brca2 mutation prevalence (24.5% vs 3.6%) has also been reported in a malaysian study of patients with tnbc with malay, chinese and indian ancestries.77 taken together, these observations suggested that brca1 mutation dominancy in patients with tnbc was present in both asian and the west.\ \ published data had shown that the prevalence of brca1/brca2 mutation was identified in approimately 20% of korean patients with bilateral breast cancers.26,69 a similar mutation analysis revealed that 20% of patients with bilateral breast cancer were brca1 mutation carriers and 12% were brca2 mutation carriers; 8% of the patients had a family history of breast and ovarian cancer in a first-degree or second-degree relative.83 similarly, a higher frequency of brca1 mutation was also seen in women with bilateral breast cancer in canada.84\ \ in addition to the widely studied brca1 and brca2, genetic testing for mutations in other familial breast cancer-associated genes, for instance, pten, tp53, atm, chek2 and palb2, using multiple-gene sequencing panels had shown its important clinical values with the advances in net-generation sequencing technology.in a recent study, 141 women tested negative for brca1/brca2 mutations had been identified for 16 pathogenic variants in other cancer susceptibility genes, giving a prevalence of 11.4% using multiple-gene sequencing.85 however, the interpretation of results from such multiple-gene panels and their applications in routine diagnostic utility remain to be optimised.moreover, the mutation data on cancer susceptibility genes other than brca1/brca2 in asian populations is also largely unknown.\ \ this review encapsulates the up-to-date brca1/brca2 mutation spectrum in asia and asians residing in western countries and provides new insights into the distribution and characteristics of brca1 and brca2 mutations in asia.the identification of common mutations in some ethnic groups or geographical locations raises the possibility of defining more efficient strategies for genetic testing.in particular, the high frequency of these mutations may provide information for genetic test panels that facilitate the ease of genetic testing for these individuals in asian countries and those asians who reside in the west, and may have value in optimising efficient strategies for genetic testing for brca1 and brca2 mutations associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility which would be particularly useful.the discrepancies of the frequencies of mutations vary across countries or even within the same country, maybe due to different selection criteria, genetic testing methods, different availability and cost of testing.in japan, a \'91myriad genetics\'92-based laboratory is used, while the other asian countries did the testing in their own laboratories, most of which were supported by research grants and donations or were even self-financed.hence, the limitations to access to these tests would be the cost and affordability of the test.the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines for \'91genetic/familial high-risk assessment: breast and ovarian\'92 provide a good backbone but it may need to be adjusted to improve applicability due to the lower incidence in breast cancer in asia, lack of family history and likely different mutation spectrum and penetrance in this ethnic group.\ \ future directions\ despite our understanding of the brca1/brca2 mutations, there remain many unanswered questions.a large number of vus still need to be classified as pathogenic or not, and due to their low frequencies of occurrence, some variants will probably never be classified.there are also increased reports of brca1/brca2 missense mutations, particularly in the less tested ethnicities, some of which have already been classified as pathogenic.such reports are likely to increase when more genetic tests are being performed in different ethnic groups.characterising vus in familial breast cancers will be the future direction of the abrca consortium group and will be included in the separated study.\ \ functional studies of brca1 and brca2 can provide valuable information on their roles in cancer development.regardless of entering the era of net-generation high-throughput sequencing, many mutations in brca1 and brca2 to date still remain unclassified in terms of their pathogenicity, and much work would need to be done to better understand the mutations of these genes, particularly in different ethnic populations.the establishment of an asian registry of brca1/brca2 mutation carriers would allow more organised research work to be done on this population.\ \ go to:\ conclusion\ brca1/brca2 mutations have been identified to be the main contributor of hereditary breast cancer, which increases the lifetime risk of breast cancer in women.the overall prevalence of brca1/brca2 mutations in asians is comparable to that in other ethnic groups.in most asian countries, the frequency of mutations in brca1 is similar or slightly higher than that in brca2, ecept in korea and philippines.with the knowledge of the mutation spectrum brca1/brca2 mutation carriers, improved genetic counselling and cancer management are likely to benefit asian patients with breast cancer.}the contribution of brca germline mutational status to breast cancer patients\'92 prognosis is unclear.we aimed to systematically review and perform meta-analysis of the available evidence of effects of brca germline mutations on multiple survival outcomes of breast cancer patients as a whole and in specific subgroups of interest, including those with triple negative breast cancer, those with ashkenazi jewish ancestry, and patients with stage i\'96iii disease.\ \ methods:\ sity studies met all inclusion criteria and were considered for this meta-analysis.these studies involved 105,220 breast cancer patients, whose 3588 (3.4%) were brca mutations carriers.the associations between brca genes mutational status and overall survival (os), breast cancer-specific survival (bcss), recurrence-free survival (rfs), and distant metastasis-free survival (dmfs) were evaluated using random-effect models.\ \ results:\ brca1 mutation carriers have worse os than brca-negative/sporadic cases (hazard ratio, hr 1.30, 95% ci: 1.11\'961.52) and worse bcss than sporadic/brca-negative cases among patients with stage i\'96iii breast cancer (hr 1.45, 95% ci: 1.01\'962.07).brca2 mutation carriers have worse bcss than sporadic/brca-negative cases (hr 1.29, 95% ci: 1.03\'961.62), although they have similar os.among triple negative breast cancer, brca1/2 mutations carriers had better os than brca-negative counterpart (hr 0.49, 95% ci: 0.26\'960.92).among ashkenazi jewish women, brca1/2 mutations carriers presented higher risk of death from breast cancer (hr 1.44, 95% ci: 1.05\'961.97) and of distant metastases (hr 1.82, 95% ci: 1.05\'963.16) than sporadic/brca-negative patients.\ \ conclusion:\ our results support the evaluation of brca mutational status in patients with high risk of harboring brca germline mutations to better define the prognosis of breast cancer in these patients.\ \ keywords: brca germline mutations, breast cancer, meta-analysis, prognosis, survival, systematic review\ go to:\ 1.\uc0\u8195 introduction\ breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of deaths from cancer in women worldwide.[1] approimately 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary, and up to 25% of the hereditary breast cancers have been linked to germline mutations of specific genes.[2] the most studied genes are brca1 and brca2, whose highly penetrant mutations are associated with the hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome, an autosomal-dominant inherited trait predisposing women to both breast and ovarian cancer.[3,4] women with brca mutations have a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer of 45% to 75% and 18% to 40%, respectively.[5\'967]\ \ brca-related breast cancer is characterized by more aggressive phenotype than sporadic breast cancer, with brca1-related breast cancer being more frequently high grade and triple negative, and brca2-related breast cancer being on average of higher histological grade than sporadic cases.[5,8\'9610] thus, it has been hypothesized that brca-associated breast cancer has a different prognosis as compared to the sporadic counterpart.however, clinical findings regarding the prognostic role of brca mutational status are controversial.few studies have reported better survival outcomes for patients with brca-associated breast cancer as compared with control groups,[11\'9614] while other studies have reported worse prognosis or no difference.this controversy is partially due to the relatively small sample size in many studies because brca1/2 mutation carriers are rare in the breast cancer population.for oncologists, it would be important to know whether brca mutational status is a reliable prognostic factor to be used for risk stratification and thus considered in the therapeutic management of hereditary breast cancer cases.\ \ the aim of the present work is to systematically review and meta-analyze the available evidence regarding the effects of brca germline mutations on multiple survival outcomes of patients with breast cancer as a whole and in specific subgroups of interest, including those with triple negative breast cancer, those with ashkenazi jewish ancestry, and patients with stage i\'96iii disease.\ \ go to:\ 2.\uc0\u8195 methods\ literature search, study design, and data analysis were performed following prisma (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines (see supplemental contents\'97prisma checklist).[15] ethical approval was not necessary for this study because this study does not involve patients.the picos (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) worksheet was used to identify the main question of the meta-analysis and define the targets of the search strategy (see in supplemental contents\'96picos worksheet, which describes type of population, intervention, type of comparison, and outcomes considered in the meta-analysis).finally, the remark (reporting recommendations for tumor marker prognostic studies) checklist was used to evaluate the quality of studies included in the meta-analysis;[16] for each study, a quality score was calculated based on the number of recommendations met by the study over the total 20 items, assigning 1 point to each met recommendation.\ \ 2.1. literature search and study selection\ we used pubmed database to search articles published until august 2016, which evaluated the impact of brca mutational status on breast cancer prognostic outcomes.to this aim, we used the following search string \'93brca \f1 \uc0\u8727  \f0  and breast cancer survival.\'94 moreover, we screened the references of all original articles as well as those cited in reviews articles focusing on this topic, in order to maimize the likelihood of identifying all relevant articles.the 2 key inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the study compared the survival of brca-positive women affected by breast cancer with that of women with sporadic/brca-negative breast cancer; (2) the article reported survival outcomes as hazard ratios (hrs) or kaplan\'96meier survival curves.screening of eligible records and selection of articles to be included in the meta-analysis were independently performed by 2 reviewers (zb and eg).disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.\ \ 2.2. endpoints and data etraction\ endpoints of the meta-analysis were overall survival (os), breast cancer-specific survival (bcss), recurrence-free survival (rfs), and distant metastasis-free survival (dmfs).for each included study, we retrieved the following information: type of genetic test, type of biospecimen used to perform the genetic test (blood/paraffin blocks of primary tumor), number of the brca-positive patients, number of the reference group patients (sporadic or brca-negative), median age of patients in the study and reference groups, ashkenazi jewish ancestry (yes/no), triple negative subtype (yes/no), pathological stage of the breast cancer, hrs and their 95% confidence interval (ci), factors considered in multivariate analysis (see supplemental contents\'96master database, which reports the pubmed identification number to retrieve the studies involved in the meta-analysis, and data for each study).etraction of data was done by zb and eg.\ \ 2.3. statistical analysis\ hazard ratios and their 95% cis were used as measures of the association between brca mutations and patients\'92 survival.the random effects model described by dersimonia and laird was used to calculate the summary hr and 95% ci.[17] three main analyses were performed based on the mutational status in the eperimental group: (1) in brca1 mutated patients; (2) in brca2 mutated patients; (3) in brca1/2 mutated patients.in the latter analysis, hrs were calculated considering data from brca1-studies, brca2-studies, and brca1/2-studies.patients with sporadic breast cancer (without being tested for brca mutational status) or brca mutation tested negative patients represented the reference group.an hr\uc0\u8202 >\u8202 1 indicated a poorer outcome for the eperimental group (i.e., brca-positive subjects).\ \ between-study heterogeneity was quantified by the i-square statistic (25% low heterogeneity, 25\'9650% medium,\uc0\u8202 >50% high).[18] in order to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity, we performed the following pre-specified subgroup analyses: first, we focused our analysis on the studies where all control patients were brca tested negative; second, we conducted separate analyses for studies including and ecluding patients with distant metastatic disease (tnm stage iv); third, we focused on studies including only patients with triple negative breast cancer; fourth, we investigated the role of brca mutational status in breast cancer patients with ashkenazi jewish ancestry as this is a population with high prevalence of brca mutations.[19\'9621] finally, mied effects meta-regression was utilized to investigate whether between-study heterogeneity is correlated with study quality, which was the ranking score from the remark checklist (range: 0\'9620) and year of study publication; both were considered as continuous covariates in the meta-regression.\ \ hrs and 95% cis were etracted from articles, when available; when unreported, they were etrapolated from kaplan\'96meier survival curves adopting a hierarchical series of steps as per parmar et al.[22] if both univariate and multivariate analyses were available, hrs from the latter were considered.however, the pooled estimates and heterogeneity analysis according to univariate and multivariate analyses are available (see supplemental contents\'97table s1, which reports pooled estimates and heterogeneity analysis according to univariate and multivariate analyses).small study effects (which includes publication bias) was evaluated by visual assessment of funnel plot symmetry and formally investigated by using egger's test.[23] the test was performed only when at least 10 studies were available.\ \ the level of significance was set at 5% with the eception of egger's test, for which a 10% level was chosen due to the low power for characterizing this test.analyses were conducted using review manager 5.2 (cochrane collaboration) and stata 14.1 (statacorp, college station, t).\ \ go to:\ 3.\uc0\u8195 results\ 3.1. characteristics of identified studies\ using the above-mentioned search strategy, 1330 records were identified from the pubmed database (flow diagram).three additional records were retrieved from review articles.[24\'9626] two duplicate articles were ecluded leaving 1331 records to be screened.after abstract reading, 82 articles were retrieved for full tet evaluation, which led to 60 articles that met all inclusion criteria and represented the data source for the following qualitative and quantitative analyses (see supplemental contents\'97master database, which reports the pubmed identification number to retrieve the studies involved in the meta-analysis, and data for each study).\ \ overall, 105,220 breast cancer patients were available within the included studies, 3588 (3.4%) being brca mutations carriers.the median number of brca carriers involved in the studies was 39.5 (range 5\'96326).table \uc0\u8203 table11 lists the number of studies, the number of brca carriers and control group patients according to gene (brca1, brca2, and brca1/2) and endpoints (os, bcss, rfs, dmfs) in all studies, and separately in studies where the entire population was tested for brca mutations.forty-two (70%) studies, involving 21,977 patients, performed the genetic test in the entire population of the study, allowing the comparison between brca carriers and true brca-negative subjects.si studies (n\u8202 =\u8202 1748) were focused on triple negative patients and 12 on ashkenazi jewish women (n\u8202 =\u8202 4161).as regards breast cancer stage, 28 (47%) studies ecluded stage iv, 25 (42%) included stage iv, and 2 (3%) were focused on metastatic disease; however, this information was not reported in 5 (8%) studies.the genetic test was performed using blood sample in 29 (48%) studies, dna etracted from formalin blocks in 13 (22%) studies, or both in 4 (7%) studies; yet this information was not specified in 14 (23%) studies.\ \ 3.2. prognostic role of brca1 gene mutations\ twenty-seven studies were included in the meta-analysis for os; in 17 (63%) studies, the genetic test was performed in the entire sample.meta-analysis showed a significant higher risk of dying for brca1 carriers as compared to the control group (hr 1.30, 95% ci: 1.11\'961.52; p-value\uc0\u8202 =\u8202 0.001, table \u8203 table22 and fig.\u8203 fig.1).1).this result was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to studies including only tested patients (hr 1.46, 95% ci: 1.12\'961.91; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.006) as well as to studies ecluding stage iv (hr 1.55, 95% ci: 1.24\'961.95; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.0001, table \u8203 table3).3).in all cases, between-study heterogeneity was moderate to low.meta-analysis for bcss, rfs, and dmfs included 16, 6, and 11 studies, respectively (table \u8203 (table1).1).no difference was found in these clinical outcomes between brca1 mutation carriers and control group (table \u8203 (table2,2, figs.\u8203 figs.22\'964).heterogeneity was high for rfs and dmfs in both general, and restricted to studies with all tested patients analyses.interestingly, the risk of dying from breast cancer was significantly higher for brca1 cases than control group when the studies including stage iv cases were ecluded from the analysis (hr 1.45, 95% ci: 1.01\'962.07; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.045, table \u8203 table33).the mean remark score was 15 (range 9\'9619) for os studies, 16 (range 13\'9619) for bcss studies, 14.5 (range 12\'9617) for rfs studies, and 17.5 (range 13\'9619) for dmfs studies.meta-regression analysis did not demonstrate any association between remark score and all considered survival outcomes, as well as between year of publication and brca1 effect on survival, with the eception of dmfs (hr decreased by 7% per year, 95 percent ci: 0\'9613%; p\u8202 =\u8202 0.049. see supplemental contents\'97figure s1, which illustrates the relationship between hrs of dmfs for brca1 mutational status and publication years).\ \ 3.3. prognostic role of brca2 gene mutations\ the prognostic role of brca2 gene mutations in terms of os, bcss, rfs, and dmfs was evaluated in 12, 10, 3, and 3 studies, respectively (table \uc0\u8203 (table1).1).in 6 os-studies and in 8 bcss-studies, all patients received the genetic test; however, all rfs studies and 2 dmfs studies compared the brca2 mutation carriers with sporadic nontested cases.the meta-analysis of these data showed a worse bcss for brca2 carriers as compared to control group in both general population (hr 1.29, 95% ci: 1.03\'961.62; p\u8202 =\u8202 0.03. table \u8203 table22 and fig.\u8203 fig.2)2) and among tested patients (1.34, 95% ci: 1.04\'961.73; p\u8202 =\u8202 0.02. table \u8203 table2),2), with low heterogeneity being observed.no difference was found between the brca2 mutation carriers and the control groups for os, rfs, or dmfs.very few studies for brca2 ecluded stage iv breast cancer (table \u8203 (table33).\ \ the mean remark score was 15.6 (range 12\'9619) for os studies, 16.3 (range 14\'9618) for bcss studies, 13.6 (range 13\'9615) for rfs studies, and 18.3 (range 17\'9619) for dmfs studies.meta-regression analysis did not demonstrate any association between remark score and all considered survival outcomes, as well as between year of publication and brca2 effect on survival (data not shown).\ \ 3.4. prognostic role of brca genes mutations\ in order to reduce potential bias due to stringent inclusion criteria, we conducted meta-analysis that accounted for data of brca1-studies, brca2-studies and studies that pooled brca1 and brca2 carriers (brca1/2-studies).brca carriers were associated with worse os (hr 1.19, 95% ci: 1.04\'961.35; p\uc0\u8202 =\u8202 0.009. table \u8203 table22 and fig.\u8203 fig.1)1) and bcss (hr 1.22, 95% ci: 1.04\'961.44; p\u8202 =\u8202 0.02 table \u8203 table22 and fig.\u8203 fig.2).2).these results were also confirmed when the analysis was restricted to studies including only tested patients (table \u8203 (table2)2) as well as to studies ecluding stage iv (table \u8203 (table3).3).rfs and dmfs of brca carriers were not significantly different of those of control group.meta-regression analysis did not show any association between remark score or year of publication for the considered survival outcomes (data not shown).\ \ 3.5. prognostic role of brca mutations in triple negative patients\ si studies (n\uc0\u8202 =\u8202 1748) focused on triple negative patients: 4 out of these 6 studies evaluated the prognostic role of brca1 mutational status and 2 studies investigated the prognostic role of brca1/2 mutational status.in all 6 studies, the genetic test was offered to entire study population.bcss and dmfs of brca1 mutation carriers did not differ from those of brca1 negative triple-negative breast cancer patients (table \u8203 (table4).4).brca1/2 carriers had better os than brca-negative triple-negative breast cancer patients (hr 0.49, 95% ci: 0.26\'960.92; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.03) but there were only 2 studies.the risk of recurrence was not statistically different between the brca carriers and brca-negative breast cancer cases (hr 0.60, ci: 0.30\'961.19; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.14).3.6. prognostic role of brca mutations in ashkenazi jewish women\ twelve studies focused on ashkenazi jewish women (n\uc0\u8202 =\u8202 4161).of these, 9 studies evaluated the prognostic role of brca1 mutational status, 3 the prognostic role of brca2 and 3 the prognostic role of brca1/2 (table \u8203 (table4).4).taking into account data derived from all studies, brca mutation carriers showed a trend for worse os (hr 1.27, 95% ci: 0.99\'961.64; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.06) and a higher risk of death from breast cancer (hr 1.44, 95% ci: 1.05\'961.97; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.02), and of distant metastasis (hr 1.82, 95% ci: 1.05\'963.16; p-value\u8202 =\u8202 0.03) than control group.\ \ 3.7. publication bias\ we found no evidence of publication bias in the 9 meta-analyses including at least 10 studies (see supplemental contents\'97figures s2\'96s5, which show funnel plots for publication bias).the only eception was represented by the meta-analysis of 27 studies investigating the relationship between brca1 mutation status and overall survival, where we found some evidence that small studies were more likely to have larger effect (egger's test p-value\uc0\u8202 =\u8202 0.081).\ \ go to:\ 4.\uc0\u8195 discussion\ the prognostic role of brca germline mutational status in breast cancer patients is unclear.in the present meta-analysis, we collected and analyzed the largest series of patients so far reported in this field of investigation.meta-analysis of the available evidence supports 4 main conclusions: (i) brca1 carriers have worse os than sporadic/brca-negative breast cancer cases; (ii) brca1 carriers have worse os and bcss than sporadic/brca-negative breast cancer cases among women with early stage breast cancer; (iii) brca2 carriers have worse bcss than sporadic/brca-negative breast cancer cases; (iv) among ashkenazi jewish breast cancer patients, brca mutation carriers have higher risk of death from breast cancer and distant metastasis as compared with sporadic/brca-negative women.\ \ the present analysis is based on data derived from a number of subjects (105,220 patients and 3588 brca mutation carriers) higher than those used in the previous 3 meta-analyses.[27\'9629] moreover, the present work provides readers with a more comprehensive analysis of the association between brca mutational status and breast cancer prognosis compared with previous meta-analyses.first, we considered 4 clinical outcomes separately to investigate the relationship between brca mutational status and all prognostic outcomes: risk of death from any cause, death from breast cancer, any recurrence, and occurrence of distant metastasis.this kind of analysis was performed only by 1 previous meta-analysis,[29] whereas the other 2 meta-analysis evaluated only os and rfs.[27,28] second, we performed 4 pre-specified subgroup analyses never reported before.in particular, we think that the analysis focusing only in the studies where the entire study population was tested for brca mutations, allowed us to better and clearly define the relationship between brca mutational status and the outcomes in breast cancer women, because the eperimental group of brca carriers was compared with true brca-negative patients.\ \ we found that brca1 mutation carriers had a 30% higher risk of dying than brca1\uc0\u8202 negative/sporadic cases, which confirmed the results of 2 previous meta-analysis studies,[27,28] although our meta-analysis included many more studies.of note, we found that the association between brca1 and os was stronger when ecluding studies with sporadic breast cancer cases (e.g., nontested for brca mutations), which eliminated misclassification bias (hr\u8202 =\u8202 1.46).furthermore, the association between brca1 and os was stronger in studies ecluding stage iv disease (hr\u8202 =\u8202 1.55) than in studies that included stage iv disease (hr\u8202 =\u8202 1.15).as regards bcss, we did not find a statistically significant association between brca1 and the risk of death from breast cancer, with moderate heterogeneity across the studies.interestingly, we found that the heterogeneity can be at least in part eplained by study design: in fact, among the 8 studies including patients with stage iv disease, no evidence of association between brca1 and bcss was observed (hr\u8202 =\u8202 0.94), whereas among the 8 studies ecluding patients with state iv disease, we found that brca1 was associated with 45% increased risk of dying from breast cancer (hr\u8202 =\u8202 1.45).thus, our findings suggest that the future prospective studies, which aim to define the role of brca1 mutational status on breast cancer outcomes, should eclude patients with stage iv breast cancer, and offer the genetic test to entire study population allowing comparison between brca carriers and tested brca-negative cases.\ \ with regard to brca2, we did not find a significant association between the mutational status of brca2 and os, which is consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses.[27\'9629] however, we demonstrated a significant association between brca2 mutation and worse bcss (hr\uc0\u8202 =\u8202 1.29), a finding even stronger after ecluding studies with sporadic breast cancer cases (hr\u8202 =\u8202 1.34).only van den broek et al[29] evaluated the association between brca2 and bcss and concluded that brca2 had worse bcss compared with the control group (hr 1.57; ci: 1.29\'961.86), but this analysis included only 2 studies, judged as high-quality studies according to a scoring system developed by the authors, without demonstrating that the quality of studies was an effect modifier.we evaluated the quality of studies using the remark checklist, a well-accepted tool to define the quality of studies evaluating a tumor marker.the remark score of the 10 studies considered in our analysis of the association between brca2 and bcss was high, with a mean score of 16.3 points out of 20. moreover, we did not find any evidence that this association depended on the remark score.therefore, we believe that our meta-analysis of 10 studies provided a more reliable estimate of the relationship between brca status and prognosis than just 2 studies considered by van den broek's meta-analysis.\ \ with the aim of comprehensively cover the topic of the prognostic role of brca mutations in breast cancer patients, we reported also the results derived from the analysis evaluating the combination of data from brca1-studies, brca2-studies, and brca1/2 studies.however, considering that breast cancer has different characteristics in brca1 and brca2 carriers, and taking into account the different prognostic role of brca1 and brca2 mutations (as demonstrated by the analysis of data of brca1-studies and brca2-studies taken separately), we suggest that the future studies should differentiate brca1 from brca2 carriers.moreover, an important question still unanswered is whether the prognosis of breast cancer in brca1 carriers is different from that in brca2 carriers, which warrants further investigation.\ \ another novel and interesting results of our work came from the meta-analyses performed in women with triple negative breast cancer and of ashkenazi jewish ancestry, 2 populations with high probability of being brca carriers.concerning the analyses on women with triple negative breast cancer, we found that the presence of brca mutations correlates with better os.however, this information derives from data of only 2 studies, where brca1/2 carriers were compared with noncarriers women, suggesting the need of more studies in this subgroup of patients.in contrast, a sufficient number of studies have evaluated the prognostic role of brca mutations in ashkenazi jewish women, demonstrating a higher risk of dying from breast cancer as well as of developing distant metastasis of brca carriers compared with sporadic/brca-negative cases.\ \ although multivariable analyses have been used in many of the studies to adjust for age at diagnosis, tumor stage, estrogen receptor status, and other clinical factors, our meta-analysis still found that brca mutation carriers had worse survival outcomes than noncarriers, suggesting that the aggressive nature of breast cancer in mutation carriers may not be fully characterized by known clinical and pathological factors.it is also possible that other causes of deaths, in particular ovarian cancer, account for the decreased os, especially for brca1 carriers because lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is higher for brca1 than for brca2 mutation carriers.[5\'967] as regard the effect of clinical and pathological factors as modifiers of survival in brca carriers, templeton et al evaluated the interaction between hormonal receptor, age at diagnosis, and survival in patients with brca1\uc0\u8202 and/or brca2 mutations.[30] these authors identified only an inverse association between estrogen receptor status and os in brca1 carriers, concluding that the estrogen receptor epression is a modifier of prognosis in brca1 carriers.future studies are required to evaluate the role of hormone receptor status in brca carriers.\ \ the quality of studies included in the present meta-analysis was moderate to high, ranging the remark score between 9 and 19 for brca1-studies, and between 14 and 19 for brca2-studies.however, we acknowledge that our meta-analysis presents some limitations.first, all studies are retrospective, which increases the risk of selection bias.second, in order to eliminate confounding factors, we used adjusted hr when both univariate and multivariate hr were reported; however, for studies reporting only univariate analysis, unadjusted hrs were considered.third, most of studies did not report important treatment information related to brca mutation carriers, such as prophylactic procedures (e.g., prophylactic mastectomy, bilateral mastectomy, bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy, treatment with tamoifen) and diagnosis of second cancers that could affect survival outcomes in these patients.fourth, despite a thorough literature search, we might have overlooked 1 or more publications on this topic; however, no publication bias was found in the meta-analyses.\ \ the controversy on the prognostic value of brca1/2 mutation in breast cancer patients is often related to the small sample size of single eisting studies, as demonstrated by the fact that more than half of the 60 eligible studies included fewer than 40 carriers.our work overcomes this limit and allows us to suggest that brca1 and brca2 mutation status has a significant prognostic value in early stage breast cancer, which supports brca mutation testing in patients with high risk of harboring brca germline mutations in order to better define the prognosis of these patients.clearly, further perspective studies with larger sample size and unified study design and analysis method are desirable, especially in subgroups such as triple-negative breast cancer patients.}abstract\ in the mammalian heart a conduction system of nodes and conducting cells generates and transduces the electrical signals evoking myocardial contractions.specialized pacemaker cells initiating and controlling cardiac contraction rhythmicity are localized in an anatomically identifiable structure of myocardial origin, the sinus node.we previously showed that in mammalian embryos sinus node cells originate from cardiac progenitors epressing the transcription factors t-bo transcription factor 3 (tb3) and islet-1 (isl1).although cardiac development and function are strikingly conserved amongst animal classes, in lower vertebrates neither structural nor molecular distinguishable components of a conduction system have been identified, questioning its evolutionary origin.here we show that zebrafish embryos lacking the lim/homeodomain-containing transcription factor isl1 display heart rate defects related to pacemaker dysfunction.moreover, 3d reconstructions of gene epression patterns in the embryonic and adult zebrafish heart led us to uncover a previously unidentified, isl1-positive and tb2b-positive region in the myocardium at the junction of the sinus venosus and atrium.through their long interconnecting cellular protrusions the identified isl1-positive cells form a ring-shaped structure.in vivo labeling of the isl1-positive cells by transgenic technology allowed their isolation and electrophysiological characterization, revealing their unique pacemaker activity.in conclusion we demonstrate that isl1-epressing cells, organized as a ring-shaped structure around the venous pole, hold the pacemaker function in the adult zebrafish heart.we have thereby identified an evolutionary conserved, structural and molecular distinguishable component of the cardiac conduction system in a lower vertebrate.\ \ go to:\ introduction\ the cardiac conduction system comprises several components, amongst which the sinus node, the site of electrical impulse generation, and the purkinje fibers transducing the impulse rapidly through the myocardium [1].the sinus node harbors specialized pacemaker cells which, due to regular and spontaneous membrane depolarization, generate the electrical signal necessary to induce cardiomyocyte contractions [2].although the sinus node was described histologically and functionally more than a century ago [3], the molecular regulators required for pacemaker cell differentiation and function are not fully understood.nonetheless, several recent developments have provided new insights.these include identification of the embryonic origins of the sinus- and atrioventricular nodes [4], [5] and of several transcriptional regulators involved in their development (reviewed in [1]).a major advance for the field was the identification of t-bo transcription factor 3 (tb3) in pacemaker cells, and the subsequent demonstration that it is required for sinus- and atrioventricular node development and postnatal homeostasis [6], [7].other transcriptional regulators that have been identified for their role in sinus node development are nk2.5, tb5, pit2 and sho2 [8]\'96[13].the molecular signature of the mouse sinus node primordium has been confirmed in human embryonic hearts, indicating evolutionary conservation of the developmental mechanism [14].\ \ the lim domain transcription factor isl1 is epressed in the mammalian cardiac progenitor cells [15], [16].isl1 epression gradually decreases during differentiation and is eventually lost in mature cardiomyocytes [15], [17], [18], ecept for myocytes pertaining to the sinus node [19], [20].due to structural heart defects and early lethality of mouse embryos deficient for isl1, its putative role in the developing and mature sinus node has remained elusive.\ \ although the presence of specialized conduction system components in the heart of lower vertebrates has been suggested by functional analysis [21]\'96[23], their identification has remained elusive due to the lack of morphologically distinctive structures and molecular markers.\ \ our research presented in this manuscript resolved this issue by describing the first molecular and structural identification of specialized cardiac pacemaker cells in the embryonic and adult zebrafish heart, utilizing a combination of in vivo microscopic eamination, 3d gene epression pattern reconstruction, reporter transgenics and e vivo electrophysiology.our findings establish that islet-1 is required for pacemaker activity in the embryonic heart and that islet-1 marks the pacemaker cells in the adult heart, which represents a previously unappreciated role for isl1 in the cardiac conduction system.\ \ go to:\ results and discussion\ cardiac pacemaker activity is affected in islet-1 mutant hearts\ zebrafish, embryos lacking functional isl1 protein are immobile and display reduced heart rate (bradycardia) at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) [24].unlike the mouse isl1 mutant hearts that fail to loop and lack recognizable chambers [15], zebrafish isl1 mutant hearts loop normally and are morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type siblings at 2 days post fertilization (dpf), allowing their functional characterization.to identify the primary defect responsible for the previously reported bradycardia phenotype we further investigated the heart rhythm in isl1 mutant embryos by high-speed video imaging combined with functional image analysis.both the isl1 mutant and wild-type sibling embryos showed initiation of contraction in the inflow region (venous pole) continuing in the atrium, followed by rapid contraction of the ventricle (movies s1 and s2).to quantify heart rhythm, we drew kymographs for atrium and ventricle of sibling and mutant hearts using a 1 piel-thick collection of lines positioned perpendicularly to the blood flow (fig.1a, white dotted lines).the resulting kymographs (fig.1b) readily confirmed the bradycardia of the isl1 mutant, as the distance between two dotted lines encompassing a full cardiac cycle (fig.1b, white double arrows) is much longer in the mutant than in the sibling.moreover, the kymograph-based quantification of the cardiac cycle (interval necessary for one complete contraction) illustrates the slow and irregular heart rhythm in isl1 mutant embryos (fig.1c).cardiac cycles of the imaged isl1 mutants oscillated between about 450 ms and 800 ms, showing not only high variability within a single embryo (fig.1c, bo-whisker plots for mutants; maimal and minimal values vary of about 200 ms for all mutants analyzed), but also between different individuals (fig.1c, mutants 1,2 and 3 display average cardiac cycle period times of 586 ms, 661 ms and 494 ms respectively over the recording time).in comparison, siblings displayed a maimal variation in cardiac cycle measured at the atrium of about 20 ms and average cardiac cycle periods of 325 ms (fig.1c, movie s1).we never observed uncoupling of the atrial and ventricular contraction, fibrillation or atrioventricular block, as every atrial contraction was followed by a ventricular contraction (fig.1b; movie s2).as development proceeded, the severity of the heart beat phenotype increased.we frequently observed a sinus block in isl1 mutant hearts at 3\'964 dpf resulting in the absence of atrial and ventricular contraction for 10\'9620 seconds (fig.1d).altogether, the combination of phenotypes displayed by the isl1 mutant is compatible with defective initiation of contraction, suggesting faulty pacemaker activity.\ \ isl1 is epressed at the putative sinoatrial boundary of the embryonic and adult heart\ in mammals, including humans, the primary pacemaker function is held by the sinus node, which resides at the junction of the superior caval vein and right atrium [25]\'96[28].for eample, in mouse, the right sinus venosus was shown to form the sinus node, which includes the venous lining of the right venous valve [4], [13].isl1-epressing cells are found in the developing and mature mammalian sinus node [14], [19], [20].\ \ we hypothesized that isl1 epression marks the pacemaker tissue in the zebrafish heart, as no molecular markers for the zebrafish sinus node or the pacemaker cells within it have been identified to date.using an antibody recognizing both zebrafish isl1 and isl2 [29] we observed few isl-positive cells in both the dorsal and ventral regions of the proposed sinoatrial junction at 2 dpf (fig.2a, b, c, d), consistent with the proposed pacemaker function at the sinoatrial junction in the zebrafish heart [21].the isl-epressing cells epressed tg(myl7:egfp), which marks cardiomyoctes.isl epression at the sinoatrial junction was detected continuously during development and was maintained in the same region in the adult zebrafish heart (fig.2e, f, g, h).this indicates that isl epression in the zebrafish proposed sinoatrial junction is constant between embryonic stages and adulthood.we continued by molecular characterization of the proposed sinoatrial junction region in the adult heart using in situ hybridization (ish).contrary to what has been observed in mammals, the zebrafish sinus venosus did not epress the myocardial marker myl7.consequently, the upstream border of myocardium muscle was at the venous valves and atrium (fig.3a, b).we observed that isl1 epression was confined to the myocardium located at the base of the venous valves (fig.3c).the zebrafish ortologue of hcn4 encodes a member of the family of ion channels responsible for the hyperpolarization-activated current, i f, in pacemaker cells.its epression is enriched in pacemaker tissue of mammalian hearts [28], [30]\'96[33].in the zebrafish adult heart hcn4 had a broader epression pattern than isl1 (fig.3d), similar to observations made in the mammalian embryonic heart [13], [14].epression of the two genes overlapped at the sinoatrial junction (fig.3d).a 3d reconstruction based on a series of ish on sagittal adult heart sections revealed that isl1 epression is confined to a ring-like structure within the myocardial tissue at the base of the venous valves, around the proposed sinoatrial junction (fig.3f).in the mammalian heart epression of nppa is specific for the fast conducting working myocardium of the atrium and ventricle but is not epressed in the slow conducting primitive myocardium of the pacemaker tissue at the sinoatrial junction [13].we observed a very similar mutually eclusive epression pattern of nppa and isl1 at the proposed sinoatrial junction of the zebrafish heart (fig.3e).furthermore, since bmp4 and tb2b are epressed at the venous pole of the embryonic heart ([24] and figure s1) and since the bmp4-tb2b regulatory ais suppresses chamber differentiation and nppa epression, we analyzed their epression in the adult heart.interestingly, epression of bmp4 and tb2b was maintained in the myocardium of the proposed sinoatrial junction of the adult heart and restricted to the base of the venous valves or the entire venous valve tissue, respectively (fig.3g, h).in summary, we identified an isl1+cell population in the hcn4+tb2b+nppa-negative myocardium that is organized in a ring-shape at the proposed sinoatrial junction.together with the above-described observation that isl1 mutants display irregular heart rhythms, this suggests that isl1 epression identifies cardiac pacemaker cells in the zebrafish heart.using an isl1-lacz knock-in model, isl1/lacz activity was observed in the sinus node of the adult mouse heart [20].corroborating these findings we detected endogenous isl1 epressing cells in the adult sinus node of the mouse heart using an anti-isl antibody (figure s2).using a similar approach we also detected isl1 epressing cells in the sinus node of the adult human heart (figure s3).interestingly, we observed that only a sub-population of sinus node cells epresses isl1, suggesting that the isl1 epressing cells have different properties compared to the isl1-negative sinus node cells.\ \ isl1-epressing cells display electrical pacemaker activity\ to functionally characterize the isl1+ cells in the zebrafish heart, we generated an isl1-gfp reporter line using the binary gal4/uas epression system (figure s4).to validate the reporter line we confirmed that all gfp+ cells were co-labeled by isl1 immunostaining (fig.3i, j, k' arrowheads).in vibratome sections gfp+ cells visualized by fluorescent antibody labeling were located in bilateral cell populations at the proposed sinoatrial junction (fig.3i, j, k, arrows), conform the ish staining.neighboring gfp+/isl1+ cells displayed cytoplasmic protrusions, which may connect them between each other (fig.3k', arrowheads).3d reconstruction of confocal image stacks revealed that isl1+ pacemaker cells are interspersed with isl-negative cells.however, they form a coherent structure (fig.3l).it is known that isolated groups of cells with residual pacemaker activity, such as remnant embryonic nodal atrioventricular canal myocytes, may cause cardiac arrhythmias (reviewed in [34], [35]).the cell-to-cell interconnection could therefore be an essential feature for proper pacemaker function, likely coordinating a synchronous activation of the myocardium.moreover, the epression of myosin is low in isl+ cells, which is supportive for a primitive myocardial identity of these cells, typical for pacemaker cells (figure s5) [27], [36], [37].\ \ to elucidate whether the gfp+ cells localize to the region in which the electrical activation is initiated, we performed optical mapping of epicardial activation patterns on adult zebrafish hearts.first moment of atrial activation corresponded with the localization of the gfp+ cells (fig.4a, b, c), which is compatible with pacemaker function for isl1 epressing cells.to unequivocally discriminate whether indeed isl1 epression marks cells with pacemaker activity, dissociated single gfp+ and gfp- cells from micro-dissected sinoatrial tissue were patch-clamped (fig.4d).all measured gfp+ cells (n\uc0\u8202 =\u8202 6) were spontaneously active, while all measured gfp- cells (n\u8202 =\u8202 8) were typically quiescent.in gfp- cells, action potentials could be elicited by current pulses through the patch pipette.figure 4d shows typical spontaneous action potentials of a gfp+ cell as well as typical action potentials recorded from a gfp- cell that was stimulated at 3 hz, i.e.with a cycle length similar close to that of the gfp+ cell (table 1).all parameters, ecept for action potential duration at 90% repolarization (apd90), differed significantly between both cell types (table 1).gfp- cells had a stable resting membrane potential of -79.0\'b11.6 mv, while gfp+ cells showed a spontaneous diastolic depolarization rate (64\'b117 mv/s) with a maimum diastolic potential of \u8722 65.0\'b13.0 mv.in gfp+ cells, this diastolic depolarization resulted in pacemaker activity with an intrinsic cycle length of 378\'b158 ms. in gfp+ cells, the maimum upstroke velocity was typically low (7.4\'b12.6 v/s) as opposed to gfp- cells (112\'b114 v/s).in both cell types, action potentials overshot the zero potential value, but the action potential amplitude was higher in gfp- cells.action potentials of gfp- cells repolarized earlier and faster, resulting in shorter apd20 and apd50.thus, the results obtained on the optical mapping and patch-clamp eperiments revealed that while gfp- cells display characteristics specific to cardiac chamber myocytes, pacemaker activity resides in isl+/gfp+ cells.we present here the molecular and functional identification of cardiac pacemaker cells in the embryonic and adult zebrafish heart.the embryonic cardiac epression pattern (fig.2) and knockout phenotype of isl1 in zebrafish (fig.1) hinted at a role for this gene in pacemaker function.indeed, analysis of 3d reconstructions of epression pattern and reporter transgenics in adult fish showed a previously unidentified ring-shaped region of isl1 epression within the myocardium at the proposed sinoatrial junction of the mature zebrafish heart (fig.3).optical mapping of the activation sequence and electrophysiological characterization of single isl1+ myocytes demonstrated the presence of pacemaker activity in the isl1-epressing cells (fig.4).altogether, our data allow us to establish that (1) isl1 is the first identified molecular marker for pacemaker cells in the zebrafish heart, (2) the functional pacemaker of the adult zebrafish heart is organized as a ring around the venous pole and (3) epression of isl1 in the pacemaker cells of the adult heart is conserved from fish to human.\ \ cells pertaining to the primary pacemaker structure in zebrafish and mammals share a number of molecular markers, relative position in the heart, and functional identity.however, while in zebrafish the isl1-epressing pacemaker cells are few and organized in a ring-shaped structure of interconnected cells in the venous valves, the mammalian sinus node is a more compact, spindle-shaped (also referred to as comma-shaped) clearly demarcated structure.although at this stage we do not know whether the ring-shaped pacemaker can be etended to other lower vertebrates, the diverging and unpronounced structure of the zebrafish sinus node and the absence of molecular markers until now may eplain why a pacemaker structure in lower vertebrates has not previously been identified.\ \ finally, the \'91primitive\'92 myocardial identity of isl1+ cells in adult zebrafish is intriguingly accompanied by a capacity to spontaneously depolarize, which is absent in working cardiomyocytes.future work focusing on isl1 and its gene targets will help to elucidate whether isl1 epression in the pacemaker cells is necessary to maintain the primitive myocardial fate of these cells, similarly to its suggested role in cardiac progenitor cells [15], [17], [18], [38].alternatively, isl1 could be required to drive a pacemaker gene program, in a similar fashion to what was shown for tb3 [7].}abstract\ the cardiac lymphatic vascular system and its potentially critical functions in heart patients have been largely underappreciated, in part due to a lack of eperimentally accessible systems.we here demonstrate that cardiac lymphatic vessels develop in young adult zebrafish, using coronary arteries to guide their epansion down the ventricle.mechanistically, we show that in ccr4a mutants with defective coronary artery development, cardiac lymphatic vessels fail to epand onto the ventricle.in regenerating adult zebrafish hearts the lymphatic vasculature undergoes etensive lymphangiogenesis in response to a cryoinjury.a significant defect in reducing the scar size after cryoinjury is observed in zebrafish with impaired vegfc/vegfr3 signaling that fail to develop intact cardiac lymphatic vessels.these results suggest that the cardiac lymphatic system can influence the regenerative potential of the myocardium.\ \ research organism: zebrafish\ go to:\ elife digest\ human hearts have coronary vessels that supply oygen and essential nutrients to the heart.when this supply is interrupted, a heart attack can occur.after a heart attack, scar tissue forms that impairs the heart\'92s ability to pump blood around the body.the heart also has lymphatic vessels that drain ecess fluid and remove waste products and damaged cells from the heart.less is known about the lymphatic vessels and their role in heart disease.\ \ unlike human hearts, which scar easily, the zebrafish heart can regenerate after injury.because of this, scientists often study zebrafish to try to find ways to improve healing of heart injuries in humans.however, it is not yet known whether lymphatic vessels contribute to regeneration of zebrafish hearts.\ \ now, harrison et al.show that, in the zebrafish heart, lymphatic vessels develop after the coronary arteries.in fact, the coronary arteries provide a scaffold that the lymphatic vessels grow along.\ \ when the zebrafish are genetically modified so that they lack coronary arteries, the lymphatic vessels fail to grow.further eperiments showed that, when the heart was injured by briefly freezing part of it, etra lymphatic vessels grew, but this did not happen when a part of the heart was removed via surgery.this may be because the cold-induced injury causes inflammation, which can trigger the growth of lymphatic vessels.the lymphatic vessels then help battle inflammation, allowing regeneration to proceed.using genetically engineered zebrafish, harrison et al.were then able to turn the genes that control lymphatic vessel growth on and off.they showed that zebrafish lacking lymphatic vessels in the heart are less efficient at regenerating heart tissue and develop more scar tissue after injury.this result is supported by the findings of a separate study conducted by gancz et al.\ \ the results suggest that stimulating the growth of lymphatic vessels or enhancing their activity in the injured heart may aid recovery.more studies may help scientists understand eactly how lymphatic vessels aid regeneration in zebrafish and whether promoting lymphatic vessel growth or activity may aid heart attack recovery in humans.\ \ go to:\ introduction\ the cardiac vascular system is comprised of blood and lymphatic vessels.arteries and connected capillaries transport oygenated, nutrient-rich blood to the myocardium.cardiac veins drain the blood back into the systemic circulation, and ecess fluid and nutrients from the blood are hydrostatically released into tissue during this process.this interstitial fluid, immune cells, debris and waste products are then drained via the cardiac lymphatic vessels.the heart critically requires this continuous cycle through the myocardium for optimal function and interruption has pathological results including myocardial infarction (mi) or cardiac lymphedema (aspelund et al., 2016; karunamuni, 2013).not only are the cardiac vessel systems required for heart function, but they are also likely to have active roles in disease resolution, at least helping to provide a permissive environment for regeneration (das et al., 2019; klotz et al., 2015; mar\'edn-juez et al., 2016).this has yet to be successfully leveraged clinically in part due to the lack of effective therapeutic strategies (taimeh et al., 2013).a more detailed understanding of these systems, their formation, regeneration and promotion of positive disease environments are critically required.\ \ zebrafish represent a simple coronary vessel system, many features of which are conserved in the mammalian system.however, unlike mammals, the coronary structure in zebrafish starts to develop relatively late at juvenile stages when endocardial cells that give rise to coronary vessels sprout from the atrioventricular (av) canal region of the heart to vascularize the ventricle (harrison et al., 2015).the eistence and development of a cardiac lymphatic system to complement this coronary system has yet to be described in zebrafish.\ \ etensive work using zebrafish embryonic models has yielded much of our understanding of embryonic lymphatic development (hogan and schulte-merker, 2017).during trunk angiogenesis, lateral plate mesoderm-derived angioblasts from the ventral side of the posterior cardinal vein (pcv) migrate to the dorsal myoseptum, lose their connection with the pcv and become lymphangioblasts known as parachordal cells (hogan et al., 2009a; nicenboim et al., 2015).these cells then migrate from the midline along arteries under the guidance of ccl12b-ccr4a/b chemokine signaling to form lymphatic vessels, including the thoracic duct between the dorsal aorta and pcv (cha et al., 2012).this thoracic duct is connected to a continuous dorsal longitudinal lymphatic vessel via intersegmental lymphatic vessels, which align along the same intersegmental arteries that provided guidance during their formation (bussmann et al., 2010).this process of trunk lymphangiogenesis is completely blocked in embryos with mutations in genes encoding the secreted vascular endothelial growth factor c (vegfc) or its receptor flt4/vegfr3 (hogan et al., 2009b; villefranc et al., 2013).\ \ vegfc is similarly required for the sprouting of lymphatic endothelial cells in mice (karkkainen et al., 2004) and, as in zebrafish embryos, these lymphatic endothelial cells are derived primarily from venous endothelium (h\'e4gerling et al., 2013; yang et al., 2012) with some contribution from non-venous sources to specific lymphatic vasculature beds (ulvmar and m\'e4kinen, 2016; eng et al., 2019).in the case of mouse cardiac lymphatic system, there is an additional contribution to the lymphatic vasculature from yolk sac endothelial cells (klotz et al., 2015).together with venous-derived lymphatic endothelial cells, they invade the embryonic heart at embryonic day (e) 12.5 from an etra-cardiac source to populate its base via the sinus venosus and outflow tract (flaht et al., 2012; klotz et al., 2015).this lymphatic endothelium then continues to sprout over the surface of the ventricle along emcn-epressing cardiac veins.vessels epressing lymphatic endothelial marker genes lyve-1, pro1 and flt4 are identifiable specifically along the side of the cardiac veins by birth and continue epanding over the ventricle until postnatal (p) day 15 (klotz et al., 2015).after a myocardial injury, the cardiac lymphatic vasculature is reactivated.despite this epansion of the lymphatic network after myocardial infarction, the mammalian heart still scars rather than regenerates functional tissue.however, a reduction in this scarring can be observed when vegfc is induced to further enhance lymphangiogenesis in injured adult mice (klotz et al., 2015).\ \ the cardiac lymphatic system is thought to regulate fluid homeostasis and provide immune system surveillance and clearance which may have important implications for cardiac tissue recovery after insult (vieira et al., 2018).in contrast to the mammals, the zebrafish has retained a remarkable capacity to regenerate cardiac tissue after tissue damage or resection (gamba et al., 2014; poss et al., 2002).after resection or moderate cryoinjury to the ape or ventral wall of the ventricle, fully functional cardiac tissue is regenerated within 30\'9690 days and there is little or no detectable scar in the majority of injured zebrafish (chablais et al., 2011; gonz\'e1lez-rosa and mercader, 2012; poss et al., 2002).the regenerated tissue is also vascularized by blood vessels by this time and this vascularization supports the function of this regenerated tissue as well as the repair process itself (mar\'edn-juez et al., 2016).\ \ historical anatomical descriptions of lymphatic vessels surrounding the fish heart (hewson and hunter, 1769) suggest that these vessels constitute an ancient feature of jawed vertebrates, but the functional overlap of this vasculature with that of mammalian lymphatic vessels has been questioned (vogel and claviez, 1981).as such the eistence and function of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature in zebrafish and its potential implication for normal tissue homeostasis as well as natural regeneration remains an open question of significant clinical interest.\ \ we here characterize of the development of zebrafish cardiac lymphatic vasculature, describe its functions and analyze lymphangiogenesis during heart regeneration.our results suggest that cardiac lymphatic vessels should be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of heart disease and may help modulate a pro-regenerative immune response.\ \ go to:\ results\ lymphatic vessels develop along coronary arteries of adult zebrafish\ to begin to investigate the subtype identity of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature in the adult zebrafish, we used the flt4:mcitrine transgenic line that is epressed in both venous and lymphatic endothelial cells (gordon et al., 2013; van impel et al., 2014).flt4:mcitrine endothelial epression is detected at either systemic pole of the heart in the sinus venosus (sv) and on the surface of the bulbus arteriosus (ba) (figure 1a).the population of endothelial cells on the outside of the ba was of particular interest given that they cover the entire ba, but do not etend down on the ventricle until adult stages (after 90dpf; figure 1a\'96c).in young adult fish, flt4:mcitrine-positive cells bud from this ba population and appear to migrate down on the ventricle to form a vessel that etends to the ape of the ventricle (figure 1b\'96d).to determine if this vasculature is venous or lymphatic we used the pro1:gal4-uas:rfp transgenic line that is not epressed in venous endothelium, but in lymphatic endothelial cells (lecs) and neurons (van impel et al., 2014).epression in the ba population suggests that this is lymphatic endothelium unlike the flt4:mcitrine-positive, pro1:gal4-uas:rfp-negative cells of the sinus venous, (figure 1e,f, figure 1\'97figure supplement 1a, b).the lack of markers eclusively specific to lymphatic endothelial cells has been one of the precluding factors for their visualization and study (jung et al., 2017).we confirmed the lymphatic identity of this endothelium with four additional reporter lines known to be epressed in lymphatic endothelial cells: lyve1b:gfp, lyve1b:dsred (okuda et al., 2012), stab1:yfp (hogan et al., 2009a) and mrc1a:gfp (jung et al., 2017) (figure 1\'97figure supplement 1c-f).as such the cardiac lymphatic system is identifiable in adult zebrafish and appears to etend from a ba population in older zebrafish.we net addressed the stage at which the ba population develops relative to coronary vessel development at juvenile stages.the formation of a cardiac lymphatic vessel on the ventricle of adult zebrafish from a pre-eisting population on the ba occurs very late and after the formation of the coronary vasculature in juvenile zebrafish.in rodent models, cardiac lymphatic vasculature on the ventricle is observed in embryos by e14.5 (klotz et al., 2015).however in zebrafish we found that the lymphatic endothelium is first established on the ba post-embryonically, before the development of the coronary vasculature (figure 1g\'96i).the lymphatic endothelium etends to the base of the ba into the cleft between the ba and the ventricle (figure 1j).within this cleft the lymphatic endothelial cells sprout along coronary vessels to etend back up out on the ventricle side (figure 1j).the sprouting lymphatic cells etend along the coronary arteries and track them as they progress down the ventricle towards the ape of the heart (figure 2a\'96f).as the cells etend towards the ape they epand and flatten around the artery to form a vessel.this vessel is in close proimity to the arterial endothelium that epresses higher levels of kdrl:mturquoise at this stage and shows more specific epression of flt1enh:tdtomato, dll4:gfp and ccr4a:mcitrine (figure 2d\'96g).this association between an artery and lymphatic vessel is also observed as the lymphatic vasculature etends along the aorta and branches off to the brachial aches.here the lymphatic vessels associate with the brachial arteries and the arterial side of the gill filaments (figure 2\'97figure supplement 1a\'96d).development of a cardiac lymphatic system is incomplete in the absence of a coronary artery scaffold\ in both zebrafish and mammals, there is a sequential development of the coronary vasculature and the cardiac lymphatic system suggesting that the coronary vessels provide a scaffold or guidance for the lymphatic system.to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the formation of cardiac lymphatic vessels in ccr4a mutant zebrafish that lack coronary arteries.unlike intersegmental lymphatic vessels, ccr4a:mcitrine epression in the adult heart is restricted to the coronary arteries and is absent in migrating lecs and lymphatic vessels that form along them (figure 3a\'96c).zebrafish with mutations in ccr4a present with disrupted coronary vessel development and largely lack formed coronary vessels in young adult fish (figure 3\'97figure supplement 1b).these mutants fail to regenerate after ventricular injury (harrison et al., 2015).in older adult ccr4a mutant zebrafish there is some formation of lumenized vessels, but the coronary vasculature structure remains highly disorganized over the ventricle.often this coronary vasculature presents as a conglomerate of enlarged or dense interconnected by sparse intermediary non-luminized vessels or isolated cells (figure 3e and f, figure 3\'97figure supplement 1a\'96f).the density of this vasculature increases with time, as observed in wildtype transgenic zebrafish, however it lacks any identifiable coronary arteries (figure 3\'97figure supplement 1g\'96h, figure 3\'97figure supplement 2c-m).analysis of lymphatic markers in ccr4a mutant zebrafish demonstrated that cardiac lymphatic vessels do not etend down the ventricle in the absence of coronary arteries, but that the pre-forming ba population is unaffected (figure 3d\'96h, figure 3\'97figure supplement 1a\'96h, figure 3\'97figure supplement 2a-m).there is a significant correlation between the etent of the coronary arterial tree over the ventricle and coverage of the ventricle by the cardiac lymphatic vessels (figure 3g, figure 3\'97figure supplement 2m), suggesting that the later uses the coronary vessels to migrate down the ventricle and that coronary artery derived signals may promote this process during development.\ \ the cardiac lymphatic system responds to injury of the ventricle\ the zebrafish ventricle shows an amazing capacity to regenerate following insult or injury and previous work suggested that vegfc epression is elevated during this regeneration process (lien et al., 2006).in adult hearts vegfc epression is observed on the ba in its junction with the ventricle base, but little detectable signal is observed on the ventricle itself (figure 4a, figure 4\'97figure supplement 1a).after amputation elevated vegfc levels are detectable at the wound site at 3dpa and 7dpa, but epression is reduced by 14dpa and absent thereafter (figure 4b, figure 4\'97figure supplement 1b-g).to test the effect of having remaining necrotic tissue and a pre-eisting etracellular matri after injury, we used the more severe cyroinjury model.cryoinjury also results in vegfc epression at 3dpc also, however subsequent epression appears to be more prolonged and remains elevated after 42dpc (figure 4c and d, figure 4\'97figure supplement 1h-l and g).following resection of the ventricle ape there is little epansion of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature, with only some hearts showing etension of the lymphatic vessels into the wound site after 14dpa (figure 4e\'96h).if present these lymphatic vessels appear to largely be etensions of the eisting lymphatic vessel into the ape and do not appear to be enlarged or epanded (figure 4e\'96h,q and r; 4/7 hearts at 60dpa show wound site lymphatic vessels).in contrast, after cryoinjury migration of lecs into the wound site is observed at 14dpc, but also enlargement and epansion of the vessel on the ventricle (figure 4i\'96p,s\'96v).particularly at later stages, a highly branched network of cardiac lymphatic vasculature is observed within the wound site (figure 4l\'96p,s\'96v).these regenerated lymphatic vessels epress flt4:mcitrine, pro1:gal4-uas:rfp, lyve1:rfp, mrc1a:egfp (figure 4l,n\'96p).quantification of lymphatic vessel coverage within a set area of the ventricle shows significantly more lymphatic vessels in or around the wound site after cryoinjury when compared to the resection model (figure 4u).in addition post-cryo-injured hearts have a more branched cardiac lymphatic structure over the ventricle (figure 4v).this suggests that the presence of necrotic tissue and scar formation promotes the formation of more lymphatic vessels after cardiac injury.we net wanted to address if this was related to the function of the cardiac lymphatic system and its potential utilization in a disease setting.\ \ click here to view.(56k, ls)\ cardiac lymphatic vasculature functionally supports the heart during regeneration and homeostasis\ the lymphatic system in mammals is known to maintain fluid homeostasis and modulate immune surveillance and clearance (alitalo, 2011).given these functions it has long been considered an integral apparatus in the maintenance of heart function and postulated to encourage a regenerative response to injury (aspelund et al., 2016; karunamuni, 2013; klotz et al., 2015; vieira et al., 2018).in order to ascertain the function of the zebrafish cardiac lymphatic vasculature and in light of the discontinuous nature of lecs sometimes observed in these vessels (figures 2 and \uc0\u8203 and4),4), we established an intra-myocardial injection assay of microspheres (ms) and quantum dots (qdots).within 1 hr both were found at the injection site (figure 5a), however the smaller qdots (<10 nm diameter) were more dispersed from the injection site as well as being concentrated within the lymphatic lumen (figure 5a\'96c, figure 5\'97video 1).this demonstrates that, despite the discontinuations in lyve1:rfp marker epression, the ventricular cardiac lymphatic vessel forms a blunt ended contiguous tube alongside the blood vessels.in addition these vessels are pervious to the uptake of fluid and small, but not large, debris as the larger microspheres (200 nm diameter) remained at the injection site, but the smaller qdots become dispersed within the interstitium and are taken up into the lymphatic vessels.\ \ in the uninjured heart, resident macrophages (labeled with ib4) were observed near the vasculature and there were very few neutrophils (mp-positive) present on the ventricle (figure 5\'97figure supplement 1a).given the strong lymphangiogenic response to cryoinjury (figure 4), we decided to investigate the immunological role of the cardiac lymphatic system after a mild cryoinjury.following injury, macrophages migrate to the wound site and are joined by a large number of neutrophil cells (figure 5\'97figure supplement 1b).clearance of these cells is known to be a key step in the process of regenerating heart tissue (lai et al., 2017; vieira et al., 2018).we find lymphatic vessels may provide a conduit for this clearance during zebrafish heart regeneration.after 1 and 7dpc (mild cryoinjury) mp-positive neutrophil cells and debris became highly enriched within or on the cardiac lymphatic vessels on the ba, a location relatively distant from the more ape ventricular wound site (figure 5d\'96h, figure 5\'97figure supplement 1c\'96g).despite weak epression on the ventricle of lyve1:gfp that precluded antibody detection above background, mp-positive cells were observed to align up along the optically dense blood vessels on the ventricle (figure 5e insert) consistent with their association and uptake into lymphatic vessels.immune cells were observed within the labeled ba cardiac lymphatic vessels after injury (figure 5g, figure 5\'97figure supplement 1e and f, figure 5\'97videos 2\'965).this suggests these cells can be taken up by the cardiac lymphatic vasculature at or near the wound site after injury and then transported away from the heart via the lymphatic vasculature on the aorta.\ \ vegfc promotes the formation of cardiac lymphatic vasculature after the initiation of coronary vessel development\ given vegfc\'92s well established role in lymphatic vasculature development (aspelund et al., 2016; joukov et al., 1996; kaipainen et al., 1995) and its potential role after injury (figure 4) we decided to test if it was utilized during cardiac lymphatic system development.we inactivated the vegfc ligands by induced epression of a soluble version of the flt4/vegfr3 receptor (serving as a ligand trap; sflt4) in transgenic juvenile zebrafish during the formation of the ventricular cardiac vessels (matsuoka et al., 2017).unepectedly, in heat shocked non-transgenic control zebrafish we observed an increase in lymphatic vessels on the heart relative to non-heat shocked controls (figure 6a,b, figure 6\'97figure supplement 1a,b,d).this increase in cardiac lymphatic vessels is not attributable to an increase in body size, in fact, heat shocked zebrafish showed a slight reduction in the overall length compared to non-heat shocked zebrafish at the same stage (figure 6\'97figure supplement 1e).in stark contrast, the induced transgenic zebrafish that epressed sflt4 from 35dpf had few or no lecs on the ventricle and no cardiac lymphatic vessels on the ventricle (figure 6c and d, figure 6\'97figure supplement 1c,d).this was also the case with sflt4 induction during and after coronary vessel induction in older juvenile (from 71dpf) and adult zebrafish respectively (from 91dpf; figure 6\'97figure supplement 1g\'96j).induction of sflt4 from 35, 71 or 92dpf did not overtly affect the development of the coronary vasculature, nor did we observe overt edema or malformation (figure 6b,c, figure 6\'97figure supplement 1b, c, f, g-n).ventricle tissue appears to be normal with sflt4 induction in juvenile zebrafish and does not significantly affect cardiomyocyte (cm) or non-cm numbers or the overall size of the ventricle (figure 6\'97figure supplement 1o-s).this suggests that functional post-embryonic vegfc signaling is specifically critical for the formation of this relatively late developing structure.we net used these zebrafish that lacked cardiac lymphatic vessels in the presence of coronary arteries to specifically test the effect of this system on cardiac regeneration.lack of cardiac lymphatic vasculature results in persistence of scar tissue following cryoinjury of the ventricle\ to test if the zebrafish cardiac lymphatic system has the potential to influence the varying levels of fibrosis observed after cardiac injury (lai et al., 2017), we used zebrafish with differing levels of cardiac lymphatic vasculature due to the developmental heat shock and induction of a sflt4 receptor (figure 6a\'96d), and performed cryoinjury and assayed scar size 60 days later without post injury induction of sflt4 (60dpc, figure 6d).scoring these scars on the basis of severity we found large deposits of scar tissue in the transgenic fish (5/5, large scar,>0.005 mm3), in comparison to that of non-transgenic siblings, where the majority of scarring was relatively small (3/5, minimal scar,<0.005 mm3) (figure 6e and f).comparison of heart tissue scaring levels shows a significant increase in scarring severity with a reduction in the cardiac lymphatic vasculature (figure 6h).hearts lacking ventricular cardiac lymphatic vessels have a significantly larger scar volume (figure 6\'97figure supplement 2a).this increase in scar volume could not be attributed to an observable defect in the coronary vasculature or a loss of coronary vessel angiogenesis at the wound site (figure 6\'97figure supplement 1a-c, g-j; figure 6\'97figure supplement 2b-e).\ \ to test if the induction of vegfc after injury supported this function we inactivated the vegfc ligands by induced epression of sflt4/vegfr3 receptor 2 days prior to and then after cryoinjury (figure 6\'97figure supplement 3a).as is the case with induction of sflt4 during cardiac lymphatic development, we observed only moderate non-significant effects on contrary vessel regeneration (figure 6\'97figure supplement 3b-g) and no relative difference in post-injury heart morphology or size with sflt4 post-injury induction (figure 6\'97figure supplement 3h-k).despite the lack of significant etension into the wound site at this stage, an increase in mp-positive neutrophils was observed at the 14dpc wound site with post injury induction of sflt4 (figure 6i\'96k), suggesting that blocking vegfc-signal could prolong the inflammatory response, potentially by limiting the removal of mp-positive cells and debris from the wound site.indeed, some sflt4-induced hearts still showed elevated neutrophil levels at later stages of regeneration (developmental induction, figure 6\'97figure supplement 2f-h; post-injury induction, figure 6\'97figure supplement 4a-c).\ \ post-injury induction to block the response of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature did result in a reduction in the regeneration of the cardiac wall and resulting internalization of the scar tissue (figure 6\'97figure supplement 4d-j).however the scar area itself showed no significant increase in these zebrafish (figure 6\'97figure supplement 4d-j).there appears to be no inhibition of the induction of cardiomyocyte proliferation or epicaridal activation following injury with overepression of sflt4 (figure 6\'97figure supplement 4k-p), suggesting instead that during regeneration the lack of ventricular cardiac lymphatic vessels, or perturbing their response to injury, shifts the balance of the wound site from pro-regenerative to pro-fibrotic.consistent with this hypothesis we observed an inability of zebrafish that lack cardiac lymphatic vessels to modulate the wound environment and to resolve scar specifically after cryoinjury (figure 6h).the majority of amputation-injured heat shocked transgenic hsp70l:sflt4 zebrafish had only minimal scaring after 30 days (30dpa, figure 6g and h).the amount of scar tissue in those zebrafish with detectable scars at 30dpa was relatively small and also observed in amputated control zebrafish, suggesting the role of cardiac lymphatic vessels is less critical for regeneration following resection (figure 6\'97figure supplement 5a\'96g).\ \ go to:\ discussion\ we here show that during zebrafish post-embryonic stages, there is a sequential development of blood vessel network and the cardiac lymphatic system as occurs embryonically in mice (flaht et al., 2012; klotz et al., 2015).the juvenile zebrafish heart undergoes significant morphological change and epansion due to the physiological demands of increasing body size on heart output (gupta and poss, 2012; harrison et al., 2015).this epanded myocardium likely requires auiliary oygenated blood supply and lymph clearance to function optimally (harrison et al., 2015; figure 1).by contrast, in mammals the evolution of the pulmonary system has permitted a much elevated systemic blood pressure and metabolic rate that requires a greater cardiac output from birth (bette et al., 2014).as such, the needs of the post-natal compact myocardium have driven the timing of cardiac blood and lymphatic vasculature development embryonically.\ \ the sequential development of cardiac blood and lymphatic vasculature is conserved between mammals and fish and has also been reported within the embryonic zebrafish trunk (bussmann et al., 2010).however, as in the zebrafish heart, intersegmental arteries, not veins, provide a scaffold for the etension of lymphatic vessel sprouts and are required for their formation (bussmann et al., 2010).we have identified a population of lecs that migrate down the arteries in the zebrafish heart (figures 1\'963) and a similar interaction of developing cardiac lymphatic vessels with arteries has been described in the human fetus (kampmeier, 1928).this is in contrast to mice in which the cardiac lymphatic vessels track cardiac veins rather than coronary arteries (klotz et al., 2015).in humans, like zebrafish, large arteries (and to lesser etent veins) are located subepicardially; in contrast the mouse heart has subepicardial veins, but deeper intramyocardial arteries (sharma et al., 2017).zebrafish lymphatic development may represent the ancestral mechanism of lymphatic guidance which has been entirely conserved or diverged to different degrees across the mammalian class (ratajska et al., 2014).in each case, the cardiac lymphatic vessels appear to follow the more superficial blood vasculature on the ventricle and our data suggest this is required for or promotes their etension over the heart.\ \ we have demonstrated that loss of the coronary artery scaffold results in a failure of these vessels to etend down the ventricle in ccr4a mutants that lack coronary arteries.although ccr4-ccl12 signaling has been implicated in the arterial association of lecs in the zebrafish trunk (cha et al., 2012), we do not observe ccr4a:mcitrine epression in lymphatic endothelial cells, but do not rule out that a similar direct signaling pathway, for eample through ccr4b, could also occur in the cardiac system and that this may be compromised in ccr4a mutants.\ \ we have however identified a signaling pathway required for the development of the cardiac lymphatic system in zebrafish.vegfc/flt4 signaling has been shown to have important roles in embryonic and perinatal angiogenesis (hogan et al., 2009a), lymphangiogenesis, (k\'fcchler et al., 2006; nurmi et al., 2015; yaniv et al., 2006) and maintenance of mature intestinal lymphatic vessels (nurmi et al., 2015; tammela et al., 2008).we here show that vegfc is critical for the outgrowth of cardiac lymphatic vessels along the arteries of the ventricles in adult zebrafish (figure 6).\ \ our eperiments also demonstrate that regular heat shock treatment of zebrafish actually promotes cardiac lymphatic development in non-transgenic control zebrafish (figure 6).such positive effect on lymphatic development is likely due to the induced stress response and associated demand on cardiac output that is observed during heat shock (sallin and ja\uc0\u378 wi\u324 ska, 2016).it also suggests that the natural epansion in adult zebrafish is regulated in part by physiological demands of the cardiac tissue to respond to the increasing body size of the fish.in much the same way, in juvenile hearts we see a requirement for a second source of blood vasculature as the myocardium epands (harrison et al., 2015).with increased vasculature and heart mass comes increased etravascular fluid and cellular waste products such that the increased interstitial fluid may need an auiliary conduit from the heart back to the circulation.the cardiac lymphatic system in zebrafish appears to have the capacity to clear fluid and debris from the myocardium (figure 5).\ \ only moderate lymphangiogenesis is observed after amputation and the majority of the vasculature in the wound site is blood vasculature (figure 4).our analyses have demonstrated that there is a marked effect on the vascular response injury after etensive tissue damage (cyroinjury).upon cryoinjury, there is a significant amount of lymphangiogenesis in and around the regeneration site that is not observed after amputation (figure 4).both injury models lead to increased vegfc levels, although this epression is more prolonged after cyroinjury (figure 4).coupled with a strong immune response to cryoinjury that could utilize the cardiac lymphatic system for the removal of cell debris and immune clearance (figure 5) we postulate that this response can avoid a prolonged inflamed wound site and aid regeneration (lai et al., 2017; vieira et al., 2018).consistent with this we see large scar tissue volume following severe cryoinjury of zebrafish ventricles that lack lymphatic vessels (figure 6).scar tissue is detectable in control ventricles at 60dpc, but the size and severity of this scar tissue is less than that observed in hsp70l:flt4 zebrafish without cardiac lymphatic vasculature (figure 6).we also observe significantly more neutrophils at the 14dpc wound site with post-injury induction sflt4 (figure 6).this is early in the response of the lymphatic vessels to injury (figure 4), but suggests compromised ability of the ventricular cardiac lymphatic vessels to remove the influ of neutrophils to the woundsite (lai et al., 2017) with blocking vegfc-signaling.we cannot rule out a direct effect on elevating the immune response with blockade of vegfc-signal, but the resulting shift has a potent negative effect on the continuing regenerative environment of the tissue, while not directly effecting cardiomyocyte proliferation, epicardial activation, coronary vessel revascularization or heart structure and morphology (figure 6).consistent with our studies using sflt4, recently it has been reported that a vegfd-mutation in a vegfc-hypermorphic background can also limit the etension of the cardiac lymphatic vessels down the ventricle while not affecting coronary vessels (vivien et al., 2019).further, almost half of the vegfc/d mutant zebrafish surviving to adulthood fail to complete regeneration by 180dpc (vivien et al., 2019).interestingly, these zebrafish also show cardiac hypertrophy, which we did not observe after induction of sflt4 at juvenile stages (figure 6\'97figure supplement 1).it remains to be determined if sflt4 induction during embryonic stages results in cardiac hypertrophy.nonetheless our results suggest that disruption of the cardiac lymphatic system impacts the hearts response to injury, rather than the enlargement of the myocardium.\ \ shifting the regenerative balance in human hearts for patients that have suffered acute myocardial infarct or insult and related sequelae will likely require the priming of a number of component systems in the heart including that which supplies blood to the injured tissue and removes fluid and debris.key for this is a detailed understanding of the development of these systems and their interaction in a regenerative environment, which will ultimately help us understand what changes to modulate in patients and how this might be done.zebrafish has provided an ecellent system to understand the development of these systems from a deeper evolutionary understanding through to the ability of these systems to regenerate and play important roles in promoting the regenerative response of adult cardiac tissue to injury.\ \ go to:\ materials and methods\ zebrafish lines\ the

described previously, as has the ccr4aum20 mutation (bussmann et al., 2011).\ \ tg(hsp70l:sflt4, cryaa:cerulean) juvenile zebrafish were heat-shocked at 39\'b0c for 1 hr 30 min, three times a week from 35d/1mpf to >6 mpf, or four times a week from 71dpf and 92dpf to >6 mpf (or up to the day prior to surgery, with then no heat-shock 21, 60dpc or 30dpa).sibling zebrafish (both transgenic and non transgenic) were raised at the same density and heat-shocked at the same time.non-heat-shocked controls born on the same day were maintained at the same density, but not subjected to heat-shock.post-injury induction was carried out in a similar fashion.for studies performed at 14 and 56dpc fish were first heat-shocked initially for 2 days prior to injury then four times per week after injury.for studies performed at 3dpc, fish were heat-shocked daily for 10 days (seven prior to injury).\ \ tg(kdrl:mturquoise) was generated as outlined (bussmann and schulte-merker, 2011 and unpublished).\ \ immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization\ standard confocal imaging was carried out as described previously (harrison et al., 2015).whole mount antibody and cleared native fluorescent zebrafish heart tissue was isolated in the same manner but fied for 2 hr at room temperature in 4% pfa/pbs before being immunolabeled or mounted in 1% agarose for clearing; further details of which included in a forthcoming publication.whole-mount immunolabeling was carried out on zebrafish hearts following fiation as follows.hearts were bleached in dent\'92s bleach (dmso:h2o2:methanol, 1:2.5:40) overnight, rinsed in methanol and then fied overnight in dent\'92s fiative (dmso:methanol 1:4) at 4\'b0c and washed in pbs + 0.1%tween (pbst) for 3 to 8 hr the net day.hearts were then incubated in primary antibody (see table 1) in blocking solution (hihs:dmso:pbs, 1:4:15) for 3\'965 days.after which they were washed with pbst for 6 hr.hearts were then incubated secondary antibody (see table 1) in blocking solution overnight, then washed in pbst for 5 hr.hearts were then mounted in low melting point agarose and imaging was carried out as before (harrison et al., 2015).section immunohistochemistry was carried out on de-waed paraffin sections (toluene 5 min 2, 100% ethanol 5 min 2, 80% ethanol 5 min, pbs 5 min 2), after antigen retrieval in unmasking solution (vector laboratories, h-3300).primary antibody (see table 1) was applied overnight at 4\'b0c in blocking solution (5% goat serum, 2.5% bsa, 0.3% triton, 1% dmso, 0.1% tween20 in tbs), after incubation for 1 hr at room temperature in this blocking solution.slides were rinsed in pbst (5 min 3) before and after application of secondary antibody (1 hr room temperature) then imaged using lsm710 and lambda/spectral imaging.\ \ section in situ hybridization was carried out on de-waed paraffin sections using rnascope multiple fluorescent assay v2 as per manufacturer's instruction (cat number 323100, advanced cell diagnostics), vegfc probe (cat number 528701, advanced cell diagnostics) was visualized with opal 690 reagent pack (pn: fp1497001kt, akoya biosciences).\ \ quantification of mp or ib4-positive cell numbers was carried out in imagej though unprojected z-planes, only cells within the lymphatic vessel endothelium were counted.imagej was used for quantification of mp and ib4-cells in and within 100 \uc0\u956 m of the woundsite and averaged across at least three images through woundsite.similarly quantification of percentage pcna/mef2c-positive cells was carried by counting double positive and mef2c-only cells within a 500 \u956 m2 window proimal to the woundsite, and then averaged across at least three images.quantification of all double positive and raldh2-only cells within an entire 708 \u956 m2 imaging window proimal to the wound site was carried out to calculate percentage of raldh2 cells (epicardium) that are proliferative.quantification of post-injury angiogenic sprouts was carried out by counting kdrl:gfp-positive sprouts within the wound site and then dividing this by woundsite area.for lyve1b:dsred-positive, flt4:mcitrine-positive lymphatic vessel coverage and kdrl:gfp-positive coronary vessel coverage intensity thresholds of a projected z-stack were used to determine the area of the lyve1-positive, flt4:mcitrine-positive or kdrl:gfp-positive vasculature on the ventricle in comparison to the total/partial area of the ventricle or woundsite as defined in tet.for ventricle size quantification, the largest afog/immune-labeled heart section of each zebrafish was imaged and area measured using threshold function in imagej.this maimum area was then plotted against, or normalized to, standard body length of the zebrafish.raw mef2c/dapi counts we made using imagej cell counter.chi-squared statistical analysis of counts was completed in prism 6 (graphpad).visualization and analysis of confocal data were carried out in zen (zeiss) and imagej, with the eception of lymphatic-neutrophil/macrophage analysis in vision4d (arivis).\ \ intramyocardial injection\ a 10 \uc0\u956 l volume of filtered microspheres (0.2 \u956 m fluoro-ma, b200, thermo fisher scientific) and qdots (qtracker705 vascular label, q21061mp, thermo fisher scientific) was prepared in 50:50 ratio and loaded into a micro-injector pulled-capillary syringe.zebrafish were anesthetized in tricaine and the chest opened and held opened with forceps.the injection was made using a femtojet microinjector (eppendorf), 1 \u956 l was injected into the ventral myocardium tissue at an acute angle to the plane of the heart.\ \ resection surgery and cryoinjury\ resection surgery and afog histology carried out as described previously (poss et al., 2002).cryoinjury was carried out as described (gonz\'e1lez-rosa and mercader, 2012), but with the modification for two injuries: a severe cryoinjury using a 0.8 mm diameter spherical probe and mild cryoinjury using a 0.6 mm dia spherical probe (10160\'9613, fine scientific tools).both are cooled in ln2 prior to application to the ventricle for 7\'9610 s after which the probe was warmed with water and removed, the post-surgery fish were returned to system water to recover.at least five zebrafish were injured per observation/group to allow for potential variability of the wound response within a single eperiment.for comparative studies sibling zebrafish were used when possible and randomly assigned into different injury groups.\ \ estimation of lymphatic vessel coverage after the injury was calculated in a fied 600 \uc0\u956 m2 square section centered on the wound site or uninjured apical region.using thresholding of the 514 nm channel in imagej area of the lymphatic vessel was calculate and results presented as percentage coverage of the fied area of measurement.to quantify the relative level of branching after injury, vessels were traced and total length calculated in imagej, then total number of bifurcations over the ventricle counted to give normalized bifurcations per unit length of vessel.for cyroinjury scar volume calculations, whole ventricle and scar (collagen and fibrin) regions were traced as regions of interest in imagej.intensity thresholding was used to select tissue to calculate the area without the inclusion of intertrabecular space.this area measurement was repeated on every 9th 7 \u956 m consecutive section through the entire heart.the individual area measurements were then multiplied by 63 \u956 m and subsequently added together to give a total estimated volume.hearts were grouped based on the volume of this scar tissue with a cut off set at 0.05 \u956 m3 above which was defined as large scar.for amputation, hearts were grouped on the basis of collagen and fibrin levels.hearts with or less than a thin layer of collagen (blue) on the inside of the thickened regenerated tissue were classed as \'91minimally scared\'92.fibrin deposition at the wound site (red) was considered indicative of scar tissue presence.level of regeneration of the cardiac tissue or level of myocardial wall thickening at the wound site was not considered in scar severity assessments.for quantification of regenerated tissue, thickened myocardial wall proimal to the scar was traced and area calculated for the section though the middle of the scar (largest scar area).for estimation of scar internalization the minimal distance of scar tissue from the edge of the tissue (epicaridum) was measured in imagej.scar area was calculated as volume, but in a single section with the largest scar area.}
