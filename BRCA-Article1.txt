Abstract
Harmful mutations of the BRCA tumor suppressor genes result in a greater lifetime risk for malignancy—breast and ovarian cancers in particular. An increased risk for male breast, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, pancreatic, prostate, and colon cancers also has been reported. The BRCA gene is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and tends to be highly penetrant; thus, there is an increased incidence of these cancers in affected families. Compared with sporadic tumors, BRCA-associated malignancies have unique manifestations, clinical features, and pathologic profiles. Manifestation at an early patient age, high-grade tumors, and an aggressive clinical course are common features of BRCA-associated malignancies. Understanding the behavior of these cancers aids in identification of affected individuals and families, who can then make informed decisions regarding their future health. Enhanced screening, prophylactic surgery, and chemoprevention are options for managing cancer risk factors in these individuals. Imaging has an important role in the screening, evaluation, staging, and follow-up of BRCA-associated malignancies. Supplemental screening of BRCA mutation carriers often begins at an early age and is critical for early and accurate cancer diagnoses. The authors review the etiopathogenesis and imaging features of BRCA-associated malignancies, the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to determining the diagnosis, and the treatment of patients who have these mutations to improve their outcomes.

SA-CME LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After completing this journal-based SA-CME activity, participants will be able to:

■ Describe the unique manifestations and characteristics of BRCA-related cancers and how they differ from sporadic cancers.

■ Identify the patterns of disease inheritance and manifestation that may indicate the presence of a BRCA mutation.

■ Discuss approaches to performing imaging to identify BRCA mutation carriers so that preventative measures and early intervention can be initiated.

Introduction
 Carriers of BRCA genes have a greater lifetime risk of developing cancer—breast and ovarian carcinomas in particular. An increased risk for other malignancies, including male breast, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, pancreatic, prostate, and colon cancers, also has been described
(1,2).
 Familiarity with the patterns of disease inheritance and manifestation that are characteristic of BRCA tumor suppressor gene mutation is critical for identifying families who carry the mutation, which enables them to undergo preventative therapy, enhanced screening, and/or early intervention
. Screening for cancer and identifying the imaging features that are indicative of BRCA-associated malignancies are integral components of a multidisciplinary approach to managing the health of patients who are born with these harmful mutations.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are large tumor suppressor genes located on chromosomes 17 and 13, respectively. These genes encode for proteins that maintain genomic stability through DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. Cells that have harmful BRCA mutations are unable to repair the DNA damage sustained during successive cell cycles, which typically results in cell death. The few surviving cells accumulate chromosomal abnormalities and undergo uncontrolled proliferation and thus cause tumor development (1). There are many variations of BRCA gene mutations, and not all of these changes carry the same risks. In fact, more than 3500 mutations of the BRCA gene have been identified (3). Estimates of the risk associated with a mutation of the BRCA genome vary owing to differences in many factors (Table), such as the mutation’s position on the genome, the population studied, environmental factors, lifestyle factors, and other genetic modifiers (4,5). Therefore, the estimated risk of cancer for one BRCA mutation carrier cannot be generalized to the entire BRCA gene carrier population. Although genes with harmful mutations are associated with substantial risk, gene mutation variants of unknown importance and benign polymorphisms also have been described (6).

Cancer Risks and Clinical Recommendations for BRCA Mutation Carriers


Note.—PFTC = primary fallopian tube carcinoma, PPSC = primary peritoneal serous carcinoma, RRSO = risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.

*Markedly fewer BRCA2 mutation carriers have PFTC and PPSC.

The BRCA gene mutation can be inherited from either parent and passed on to both daughters and sons in an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. Each first-degree relative of a BRCA mutation carrier has a 50% chance of also being a carrier of the mutated gene. One in 400–800 women are estimated to have these pathologic germ line mutations, but the incidence varies according to the specific population studied. For example, up to one in 50 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are estimated to be a carrier of a BRCA mutation (7,8).

In this article, we review the pathophysiologic and imaging features of tumors associated with BRCA mutations. These cancers include carcinomas of the breast, ovary, peritoneum, fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate, and colon. Imaging has an important role in the evaluation, staging, and follow-up of patients with BRCA mutations. However, because of the overlap in imaging features among these diverse entities, a definitive diagnosis is best established with histopathologic analysis and genetic testing. Nevertheless, familiarity with the pathogenesis, imaging features, and treatment of these tumors can aid in rendering radiologic diagnoses and guide appropriate patient treatment.

Breast Cancer
In 2016, the American Cancer Society estimated that 246 660 women in the United States would be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (9). Women with a BRCA mutation have a substantially greater risk of developing breast cancer compared with the general population, which has an average lifetime risk of 12.3% (9). According to recent estimates, 55%–65% of female BRCA1 mutation carriers and approximately 45% of female BRCA2 mutation carriers will develop breast cancer by age 70 years (10,11). BRCA gene mutations are estimated to account for 5%–10% of all breast cancers—those manifesting before menopause in particular (12). The frequency of a mutation varies according to the population studied. For example, among Ashkenazi Jewish women, approximately 12% of all breast cancers and 35% of all ovarian cancers are due to one of three founder BRCA mutations (13). Mutations of BRCA genes have been identified in up to 45% of families with multiple cases of breast cancer and in up to 90% of families with cases of both breast and ovarian cancers (2,14).

Specific cancer phenotypes are associated with BRCA mutations, with the clinical features and pathologic profiles of tumors differing according to the type of mutation.

 The morphologic and molecular phenotypes of breast cancers may help in identifying individuals who are likely to carry germ line mutations of BRCA genes.
BRCA mutation carriers are diagnosed at a younger age than are women at average risk. The median age of BRCA carriers at diagnosis of invasive breast cancer is 40 years (15) compared with 61 years in the general population. BRCA mutation carriers have an approximate 3% risk of developing breast cancer before the age of 30 years (5) compared with the approximate 0.07% risk in the general population at that age estimated by the American Cancer Society (16).
Pathologic Features
More than 80% of the invasive breast cancers in BRCA mutation carriers are invasive ductal carcinomas, and 2%–8% are invasive lobular carcinomas (15). Although medullary breast cancers account for less than 1% of sporadic breast malignancies, they are seen in up to 19% of BRCA1 mutation carriers, and approximately 15% of patients with medullary breast cancer carry the BRCA1 mutation (Fig 1). This increased frequency of the medullary cancer subtype has not been observed among BRCA2 mutation carriers (17,18). Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is almost never identified in BRCA1 mutation carriers. The rates of DCIS in BRCA2 mutation carriers are similar to the rates of DCIS in sporadic cases (19,20). Primary bilateral breast cancer is uncommon in the general population: only 11% of patients with breast cancer who are treated develop a contralateral breast cancer (21). In contrast, BRCA mutation carriers who are diagnosed with breast cancer have an up to 63% risk of developing a second primary contralateral breast cancer during the 25 years following the initial diagnosis, with the highest risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers diagnosed before age 40 years (Fig 2) (22). Breast cancers in females with a BRCA1 germ line mutation are more often (in 69% of cases) estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative—that is, “triple negative”—compared with breast cancers in the general population (in 10%–20% of cases). In addition, breast cancers in this specific group are more often high-grade and poorly differentiated tumors compared with those in non–mutation carriers (Fig 3) (15). BRCA2-associated breast cancers are similar to sporadic breast cancers, more than 75% of which are estrogen receptor positive and only 16% of which are triple negative (15). BRCA2-associated breast cancers have a higher grade than do tumors in age-matched control patients with sporadic cancers (23).

Role of Imaging
Mammography.—The sensitivity of mammography for the detection of breast carcinoma in BRCA mutation carriers is estimated to be 30%, which is much lower than its estimated 83% sensitivity for detection in the general population (24,25). The incidence of interval cancers in BRCA mutation carriers who undergo only mammography annually for surveillance is quite high: nearly half of the women in this group are diagnosed with breast cancer less than 1 year after having normal mammography results (26). The decreased sensitivity of mammography in this group is multifactorial. BRCA-associated breast cancers have a higher growth rate, and therefore a short lead time, which results in more interval cancers (15). Also, patients with BRCA mutations are younger at diagnosis than are individuals in the general population, and the low sensitivity of mammography is due in part to cancers masked by dense breast tissue (27). In younger women with dense breast tissue, digital mammography is more accurate for the detection of breast cancer than is film hard-copy mammography (28) and is recommended for this population. The role of digital breast tomosynthesis in BRCA mutation carriers has not been well studied. Investigators in a series (29) involving 324 patients with a strong family history of breast cancer, including 11 BRCA mutation carriers, found no detectable incremental benefit to performing tomosynthesis, as compared with digital mammography, in patients who were at high risk owing to family history or BRCA mutation. However, digital breast tomosynthesis has been shown to be most beneficial in women with dense breasts and should be considered for BRCA mutation carriers with a nonfatty breast composition (30). Finally, BRCA-associated breast malignancies frequently have imaging features that are commonly seen in benign lesions and thus that may lead to false-negative results.

A malignant lesion in the breast is best detected at mammography if it is a spiculated mass, is associated with architectural distortion, or exhibits malignant calcifications. These features are less frequent in cancers in BRCA mutation carriers. BRCA-associated breast malignancies are less likely to exhibit the malignant calcifications seen at mammography. When present, DCIS is calcified in approximately 75% of sporadic cancers, but DCIS is rare in BRCA1 mutation carriers (20,31). In a prospective cohort study, Schrading and Kuhl (19) found that none of the 14 BRCA1-associated invasive breast cancers exhibited malignant calcifications. About 40% of the BRCA2-associated invasive breast cancers demonstrated mammographically visible calcifications, similar to the 30%–50% prevalence of malignant calcifications seen with sporadic invasive cancers (19,32). BRCA-associated breast cancers also commonly manifest with benign-appearing shapes and margins. The most commonly described mammographic feature of BRCA-associated breast cancers is a well-defined mass (19,20,33). In a series involving 29 BRCA mutation carriers with mammographically detected malignant lesions, Veltman et al (33) reported that these lesions were more often round with sharp well-defined margins, as compared with the malignant lesions in a matched sporadic control group. These findings are thought to be due to the fact that the majority of BRCA-associated breast malignancies are high-grade tumors, which often appear as well-defined masses with sharp margins (33). In addition, medullary breast cancers are frequently seen in BRCA1 mutation carriers and tend to be well-circumscribed noncalcified round or oval masses (Fig 4) (17). These imaging findings in BRCA-associated cancers are in contrast to the smooth masses seen at screening mammography in the general population, more than 99% of which prove to be benign (34). Therefore, the finding of a mass with round and smooth margins cannot be used to determine benignity in BRCA mutation carriers. Kaas and coworkers (35) also described the typical benign mammographic features in their study of 31 BRCA-associated breast cancers and concluded that all mammographically detected lesions, regardless of their imaging features, should be further evaluated with US and biopsy.

Ultrasonography.—The US appearance of BRCA-associated breast cancers often resembles that of benign lesions, fibroadenomas in particular. At US, these lesions are typically round, well circumscribed, hypoechoic, and homogeneous and have enhanced sound transmission (36). Hamilton et al (20) evaluated 28 BRCA-associated breast malignancies with US and classified more than half of them as benign or indeterminate on the basis of their US appearance. These findings highlight the limitation of US for accurate differentiation of benign versus malignant masses in this cohort. In a prospective study involving 236 BRCA mutation carriers, Warner et al (24) reported 33% sensitivity in the detection of breast cancers with US screening. Supplemental screening with US in this group of women provides no additional benefit relative to screening with mammography and MR imaging (37). However, breast US is a useful supplemental screening tool for women at high risk who have contraindications to MR imaging (37).

MR Imaging.—With MR imaging screening of women with BRCA mutations, the majority of breast cancers can be depicted at a very early stage (34–36). Investigators in several studies to compare mammography, US, and MR imaging for screening have reported MR imaging to have higher sensitivity for cancer detection in women at high risk. The sensitivity and specificity of breast MR imaging have been reported to be as high as 100% and 97%, respectively (37,38). Passaperuma et al (39) compared annual MR imaging with annual mammography in a prospective screening trial involving 500 BRCA mutation carriers and found MR imaging to have 94% sensitivity compared with the 9% sensitivity of mammography. Ninety-seven percent of the incident cancers were stage 0 or I malignancies; these results establish the capability of MR imaging to depict early-stage and potentially curable cancers in this population (Fig 5). In another prospective study, Warner et al (40) reported that the incidence of advanced breast cancer in 1275 women with a BRCA mutation who underwent regular MR imaging screening was reduced by 70% during a 6-year follow-up period, compared with the incidence of advanced breast cancer in those who underwent conventional mammography.

However, similar to those seen at mammography, the malignant lesions seen in BRCA mutation carriers at MR imaging frequently have features that are commonly seen in benign lesions. In a study involving 29 BRCA mutation carriers with breast cancer, Veltman et al (33) found that the BRCA mutation carrier group, as compared with the control patients with sporadic cancers, had lesions that were substantially more often described as round with sharp well-defined margins at MR imaging. However, like sporadic cancers, BRCA-associated breast cancers often demonstrate the typical malignant type 3 heterogeneous enhancement pattern and washout kinetic properties (33). In addition, the malignancy-related imaging feature of rim enhancement is more often described in BRCA mutation carriers than in control subjects and has been associated with aggressive malignancies (33). Typical benign patterns such as homogeneous internal enhancement also have been described in BRCA-associated breast cancers (33). In a study involving 68 women at high risk of developing breast cancer, including BRCA mutation carriers, Schrading and Kuhl (19) found 15 homogeneously enhancing round or oval smoothly marginated masses that proved to be malignant (19).

Breast MR imaging has been previously described as having lower sensitivity for the detection of DCIS than for the detection of invasive cancer (41). In the Veltman et al study (33), all of the cancers in the BRCA mutation cohort that were missed at MR imaging were confirmed to be DCIS, yet they were seen as calcifications or a mass at mammography. However, in a prospective study by Kuhl et al (42), MR imaging was found to be more sensitive than mammography for the detection of DCIS in 7319 women at high risk. The important result is that mammography depicted the few cases of DCIS that were missed at MR imaging, and for this reason combined MR imaging and mammography are currently recommended for screening BRCA mutation carriers (42).

 Given the frequent observation of benign imaging features in BRCA-related breast malignancies, the classification of lesions as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 3 (probably benign) tumors is not recommended in this patient cohort.
In these patients, this category should be assigned with extreme caution and only after a complete and thorough diagnostic imaging assessment. Because the chance of developing breast cancer is high for these women, almost any detected lesion should, in practice, be classified as suspicious for malignancy until proven otherwise.
Cancer Staging
The sites of metastatic disease originating from BRCA1-related, BRCA2-related, and sporadic breast cancers differ substantially. BRCA1 carriers develop comparatively fewer bone and more lung metastases. About two-thirds of BRCA1 mutation carriers with stage IV cancer develop brain metastases, which are rare in BRCA2 mutation carriers. In approximately 10% of stage IV sporadic breast cancer cases, the patient develops brain metastasis (43). It is important to consider these patterns of spread when staging cancers and following up patients with metastatic disease so that the common sites of metastasis will be included in the imaging evaluation.

Screening Guidelines
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends that breast cancer surveillance for women with a BRCA mutation begins with breast awareness measures, starting at age 18 years. Women should undergo clinical breast examinations every 6–12 months, starting at age 25 years, and undergo annual breast MR imaging examinations (or mammography if MR imaging is not available), starting at ages 25–29 years. They should undergo annual mammography combined with breast MR imaging at ages 30–75 years. Due to the high tumor growth rate and shorter lead time of BRCA-related breast cancers, alternating MR imaging and mammographic screening examinations at 6-month intervals also may be a clinically effective approach (44).

In the NCCN guidelines, it is recommended that physicians discuss prophylactic mastectomy with BRCA mutation carriers, as it offers almost complete protection against breast cancer. BRCA mutation carriers who undergo prophylactic mastectomy reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by at least 90% (45,46). In women who choose not to undergo preventive mastectomy, chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene should be considered (47). In one case-controlled study involving 209 BRCA mutation carriers, the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer in the BRCA mutation carriers was shown to have decreased by 50% when tamoxifen was used to treat the initial breast cancer (48). This agent may be equally effective for the primary prevention of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers; however, this has not yet been proven.

The NCCN has established criteria for the genetic counseling and testing of individuals who are at risk for carrying a BRCA mutation (44). These criteria include having a family member with a known BRCA mutation or having a personal or family history of cancers with characteristics that suggest they are related to a BRCA mutation. These include breast cancers diagnosed in young patients, triple-negative breast cancers in women younger than 60 years, bilateral breast cancers, multiple cases of breast cancer in a family, ovarian cancer, male breast cancer, cancers in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, and other malignancies (44).

Male Breast Cancer
According to the American Cancer Society, male breast cancer is rare, with an estimated 2600 new cases having been identified in 2016. The risk for breast cancer in men who carry a BRCA mutation is much higher than that in the general population. By age 70 years, there is a lifetime risk of 1.2% in male BRCA1 mutation carriers and 6.8% in male BRCA2 mutation carriers, compared with a 0.1% risk in the general population (49). Of men who are diagnosed with breast cancer, up to 10% carry the BRCA1 mutation (50) and up to 40% carry the BRCA2 mutation. The prevalence is higher in populations with founder mutations and in men whose families are at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer (51).

The median patient age at diagnosis of BRCA-associated male breast cancer is 60 years, compared with 67 years in the general population, and highly associated with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer (52). The relative risk for breast cancer is highest for male BRCA mutation carriers in their 3rd and 4th decades of life, and it decreases with increasing age (49). BRCA-associated breast cancers in males are similar to sporadic breast cancers in males in that more than 95% of these malignancies are invasive ductal carcinomas and almost all of them are estrogen receptor positive (>90%), progesterone receptor positive (>75%), or human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative (>80%). However, BRCA-related male breast cancers are more frequently—in 60% of cases—high-grade tumors, compared with sporadic male breast cancers, less than 40% of which are high-grade tumors (Fig 6) (53). The imaging appearances of BRCA-related male breast cancers have not been studied. However, in a series of 236 male breast cancers, the majority of malignancies reportedly manifested as an irregular mass without calcifications (54). It is important to note that 20% of these cancers were described as having a circumscribed margin (54). Therefore, any solid mass in the breast of a male BRCA mutation carrier, regardless of whether it has benign imaging features, should be examined immediately at biopsy. The NCCN recommends that men who carry a BRCA mutation begin breast self-examinations at age 35 years. There are limited data that support performing screening mammography in men. According to NCCN guidelines, any male diagnosed with breast cancer should undergo genetic counseling (44).

Management
The treatment of BRCA-associated breast cancers is similar to that of sporadic breast cancers, with some exceptions. Because BRCA genes are involved in DNA repair, these cancers may be more sensitive to radiation and agents that act by damaging DNA, such as cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. In early studies of poly(adenosine 5’-diphosphate–ribose) polymerase inhibitors, agents that block the repair of DNA damage, these agents were found to arrest the growth of cancer cells that have BRCA mutations (55).

Extrauterine Pelvic Serous Carcinomas
Ovarian Cancer
Women with harmful BRCA mutations have a substantially greater lifetime risk for developing ovarian cancer. Approximately 40% of women with a harmful BRCA1 mutation and 11%–17% of women with a harmful BRCA2 mutation develop ovarian cancer by age 70 years (10,11). More than 90% of BRCA-associated ovarian cancers, as compared with 50% of sporadic control cancers, are serous adenocarcinomas, and these tumors tend to be of a higher grade than sporadic tumors (56). BRCA mutations are rarely seen in patients with mucinous or borderline ovarian tumors (57,58). BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas are reported to manifest an average of 5–10 years earlier than sporadic ovarian carcinomas. These cancers typically manifest in patients in the 4th and 5th decades of life, and 10% of them are diagnosed in patients before they are aged 40 years. Similar to sporadic ovarian carcinomas, BRCA2-associated ovarian carcinomas manifest in patients at an average age of 63 years (58). There are no marked differences in ovarian cancer morphology or grade between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (15). Meticulous histopathologic analyses of prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy specimens from women with BRCA mutations have revealed that the majority of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas originate from occult invasive and noninvasive carcinomas that arise from the fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes. These cancers are referred to as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (59).

The imaging features of serous ovarian cancers are similar between BRCA-associated and sporadic cases. On computed tomographic (CT) and MR images, heterogeneously enhancing solid masses with scattered areas of hemorrhage, cystic change, necrosis, and papillary projections are suggestive of high-grade serous cancers (Fig 7) (60,61). Ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and enlarged lymph nodes also are commonly seen with high-grade serous carcinomas. BRCA-associated ovarian cancers have distinct responses to treatment; they tend to be more sensitive to platinum agents and poly(adenosine 5’-diphosphate–ribose) polymerase inhibitors than sporadic cancers (62). Study results have shown that BRCA2-associated ovarian cancers are associated with a better 5-year overall survival rate (52%), as compared with BRCA1-associated (44%) and sporadic (36%) ovarian cancers (63).

In the current NCCN guidelines, RRSO is recommended for women with BRCA mutations who are between the ages of 35 and 40 years and have completed childbearing (44). RRSO for prevention of ovarian cancer results in a marked (≥85%) reduction in the risk for BRCA carriers developing ovarian carcinoma (64). However, after RRSO, an approximate 4% risk for primary peritoneal cancer remains (65). An additional benefit for BRCA carriers who undergo RRSO is a 50% reduction in the risk for breast cancer when the procedure is performed before the onset of menopause. The earlier the procedure is performed, the greater the risk reduction (64). It is important to note that although prophylactic mastectomy and RRSO result in substantial reductions in cancer risk, these procedures can be associated with adverse physical and psychological effects (66). Women with a BRCA mutation who do not undergo RRSO can choose surveillance with periodic transvaginal US, periodic serum CA-125 level assessment, and clinical examination every 6–12 months, starting at ages 30–35 years or 10 years before the earliest ovarian cancer diagnosis in the family (56). It is important to note that no surveillance method has been shown to facilitate the detection of ovarian cancer at a stage early enough to reduce the risk of dying of this malignancy (53,67).

One alternative to RRSO is the use of oral contraceptives to prevent ovarian cancer, which results in a 40%–50% reduction in the risk for ovarian cancer among BRCA mutation carriers (68). The use of oral contraceptives does not increase the risk for breast cancer in women already at high risk (69). The NCCN recommends genetic counseling for all patients with invasive nonmucinous epithelial ovarian carcinomas, regardless of the presence or absence of a family history of breast and/or ovarian carcinoma (44).

PFTC and PPSC
Women with harmful BRCA mutations have a substantially greater lifetime risk for developing PFTC and PPSC (70). These two uncommon malignancies and serous ovarian carcinoma have many similarities, including histologic, clinical, and etiologic factors. The distal fallopian tube seems to be the dominant site of origin of early malignancies, which are detected in approximately 6% of asymptomatic women after RRSO (71) (Fig 8). The most important change in the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics for the classification of ovarian cancer is the addition of PFTC and PPSC, which arise from the fallopian tube and peritoneum. All of these tumors are now classified under one unified system that guides appropriate treatment (72). PFTC is highly associated with the BRCA1 mutation, with relative risks for carriers reportedly as high as 120 compared with the risk in the general population (73). BRCA1 mutation carriers are also at risk for developing PPSC, with a cumulative risk of 4% after RRSO (65). PFTC and PPSC are also associated with BRCA2 mutations but less frequently (65,70).

US may depict the primary polypoid mass in the fallopian tube (Fig 9). On CT and MR images, PFTCs appear as cystic and solid adnexal masses with mild to moderate enhancement that is lower than the enhancement of the normal myometrium. At MR imaging, the solid components are isointense to mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images (Fig 10) (74). Ascites, peritoneal nodules, and omental nodularity or caking in the absence of an adnexal mass in a postmenopausal woman should raise suspicion for PPSC (Fig 11) (75,76). Large solid pelvic masses, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions are the other common imaging findings of PPSC. The NCCN recommends genetic counseling for all patients with PFTC and PPSC, regardless of the presence or absence of a family history of breast and/or ovarian carcinoma (44).

Pancreatic Cancer
The relative risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a BRCA mutation carrier is between 2.26 and 5.90 compared with the risk in the general population (4,77). In a study by Iqbal et al (78), the risk of PDAC was approximately doubled in female BRCA carriers. The presence of PDAC in a patient with a strong family history of breast cancer may be a statistically significant predictor of BRCA2 mutation, although BRCA1 mutation carriers also have been found to have an increased risk (79). Between 4% and 7% of all unselected patients with PDAC are believed to be BRCA mutation carriers (80).

The patient age at presentation, clinical findings, tumor stage, histologic grade, patient survival rate, and other clinicopathologic features of BRCA-associated PDACs are similar to those of their sporadic counterparts (80). At CT and MR imaging, PDAC appears as a hypoenhancing mass (Fig 12b) with biliary and/or main pancreatic ductal dilatation. Endoscopic US is useful in the detection of small lesions and tissue sampling. BRCA-associated PDACs may be more responsive to certain types of chemotherapeutic agents, such as mitomycin, cisplatin, and poly(adenosine 5’-diphosphate–ribose) polymerase inhibitors, that target the DNA repair defects in tumor cells (81). In the NCCN guidelines, genetic counseling is recommended for any person (a) of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with a history of pancreatic cancer at any age, (b) with more than one relative with ovarian cancer at any age or breast cancer at an age younger than 50 years, or (c) with at least two relatives with breast, pancreatic, or high-grade prostate cancer at any age (44).

Prostate Cancer
There is a greater risk for prostate cancer in carriers of BRCA mutations. The risk for prostate cancer is increased 3.5-fold in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation, whereas BRCA2 mutation carriers younger than 65 years have a 8.6-fold increase in risk (77,82,83). The overall lifetime risk for prostate cancer is 9.5% for BRCA1 carriers and 20.0% for BRCA2 carriers (82). Compared with sporadic prostate cancer,

 BRCA-associated prostate cancers are associated with a high histoloic grade, a more aggressive clinical course, higher prostate-specific antigen levels at diagnosis, higher likelihoods of lymph node involvement and distant metastasis at diagnosis, and decreased overall survival
(82,84,85).
In the setting of prostate cancer, multiparametric MR imaging is pivotal for detection, localization, characterization, staging, biopsy analysis, risk stratification, treatment selection, and active surveillance (86). Version 2 of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System guidelines for standardizing the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of prostate lesions at MR imaging has been approved (87). Prostate carcinoma appears as a hypointense mass on T2-weighted MR images, with restricted diffusion and high signal intensity on high–b-value diffusion-weighted MR images, low signal intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient maps, early focal enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images, and washout kinetic properties (Fig 13) (86,87). Contrast-enhanced CT is useful for the identification of lymph nodes and distant metastatic disease, and technetium Tc 99m medronate bone scintigraphy or FDG–sodium fluoride PET/CT can aid in the detection of osseous metastatic disease (Fig 14).

Biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 4 + 3. Results of subsequent genetic testing confirmed that this patient had abnormal BRCA2 gene mutations, which are associated with a poor prognosis.

The NCCN recommends prostate cancer screening for men with BRCA2 mutations, beginning at age 40 years, and male BRCA1 mutation carriers are advised to consider this screening protocol as well. Annual digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen testing are recommended for these groups in the American Cancer Sociey prostate screening guidelines (88). The NCCN also recommends genetic counseling for any man who has (a)a personal history of prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7) at any age with at least one close relative with ovarian cancer at any age or breast cancer at age 50 years or younger, or (b) at least two relatives with breast, pancreatic, or high-grade prostate cancer at any age (44).

Colorectal Cancer
The risk for colorectal cancer is greater in women who harbor BRCA mutations. In a recent prospective cohort study involving 7015 women with BRCA mutations, Sopik et al (89) reported a fivefold greater risk for colorectal cancer in female BRCA1 mutation carriers younger than 50 years. This finding corresponds to a risk of about 1.0% at age 50 years in BRCA1 mutation carriers, as compared with a 0.2% risk in the general population at that age (90). In another study, Phelan et al (91) also reported a higher risk for colon cancer in female BRCA1 mutation carriers younger than 50 years.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of colon cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers. CT of the abdomen and pelvis enhanced with intravenously administered iodinated contrast material is the imaging examination of choice for evaluating patients with colon adenocarcinoma. At CT, typical imaging findings of colon adenocarcinoma include an irregular masslike thickening involving the colon and/or rectum, with associated lymphadenopathy (Fig 15). Although CT can depict obvious metastatic liver lesions, contrast-enhanced liver MR imaging is very useful for the detection of subtle lesions. MR imaging is also extremely valuable in the local staging of rectal cancer (91). FDG PET/CT is pivotal for the identification and long-term surveillance of distant metastatic disease and has an important role in providing prognostic information.

(a, b) Axial contrast-enhanced CT image (a) and axial FDG PET scan subsequently obtained for staging of rectal carcinoma (b) show a large enhancing rectal tumor (arrow) exhibiting FDG avidity. Results of postsurgical histopathologic analysis confirmed the presence of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. (c) Axial FDG PET image at a higher level shows a clinically occult mass (arrowhead) in the left breast, with marked FDG avidity. (d) Axial contrast-enhanced CT image of the chest shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass (arrowhead) in the left breast, which was subsequently proved to be a synchronous, poorly differentiated invasive breast carcinoma.

Although there are no NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer screening of BRCA mutation carriers, women younger than 50 years with BRCA1 mutations should consider undergoing colonoscopy every 3–5 years, beginning at age 40 years (44,92). All BRCA mutation carriers aged 50 years or older should be advised to follow the current NCCN guidelines for the general population. These guidelines include screening that involves annual fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years combined with fecal occult blood testing every 3 years, or screening colonoscopy every 10 years. CT colonography may be beneficial for those who cannot undergo optical colonoscopy (92). The natural evolution of and prognosis associated with BRCA1-associated colorectal cancers have not been completely characterized; thus, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of colonoscopy or the optimal screening interval (89). Low-dose aspirin may be a risk-reducing chemopreventive option for BRCA mutation carriers (89).

Conclusion
Identification of the BRCA gene and subsequent characterization of the clinicopathologic manifestations of BRCA mutations enable the carriers of these mutations to be identified. Radiologists and referring physicians should become familiar with the unique features of BRCA-associated malignancies and the recommendations for preventative therapy, screening, and early intervention in BRCA mutation carriers.
